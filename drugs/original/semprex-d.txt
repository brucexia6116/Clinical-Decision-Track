Although acrivastine has little effect on the central nervous system, a reduction in motor skills when taken with alcohol has been seen in at least one study.  Patients should be warned not to take acrivastine with alcohol or other sedating drugs.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects of pseudoephedrine have included  stimulation, resulting in tremor, anxiety, and nervousness.  Insomnia has been reported in up to 30% of pseudoephedrine-treated patients.  Headache has also been reported.Nervous system side effects of acrivastine have included uncommon reports of sedation especially when given in combination with pseudoephedrine.  Acrivastine has caused more sedation than placebo, but less than other antihistamines with sedating qualities.  Acrivastine has also rarely caused headache, somnolence, and dizziness.[Ref]
Cardiovascular side effects of pseudoephedrine have included significant increases in heart rate.  Hypertension and arrhythmias may be problematic in susceptible patients.[Ref]
Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which generally does not produce hypertension, but may be problematic for patients with preexisting hypertension.  Arrhythmias may be produced in predisposed patients.  Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been reported to cause coronary artery spasm and chest pain.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects of pseudoephedrine have included anorexia and gastric irritation in approximately 5% of patients.  Dry mouth, nose, or throat has occurred in up to 15% of patients.Gastrointestinal side effects of acrivastine have included dry mouth, and rarely, nausea.[Ref]
Hypersensitivity side effects of pseudoephedrine have included reports of fixed drug eruptions.Hypersensitivity side effects of acrivastine have included rare reports of reactions.[Ref]
