In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by saquinavir (the active ingredient contained in Fortovase). In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking saquinavir:
Some of the side effects that can occur with saquinavir may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:
