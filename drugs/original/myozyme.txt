The most common side effects were hypersensitivity reactions, fever, diarrhea, rash, vomiting, cough, pneumonia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, and decreased oxygen saturation.  The most serious side effects were anaphylactic reactions, acute cardiorespiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.  The most common serious side effects were pneumonia, respiratory failure, respiratory distress, catheter-related infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, gastroenteritis, and fever.[Ref]
The most common side effects that required intervention in clinical trials in infantile-onset and juvenile-onset Pompe disease were hypersensitivity reactions (51%) and included rash, pyrexia, urticaria, flushing, decreased oxygen saturation, cough, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension/increased blood pressure, pallor, rigors, vomiting, cyanosis, agitation, and tremor.  These side effects occurred more often with higher infusion rates.  Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in some patients who were pretreated with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids.Delayed-onset hypersensitivity reactions (defined as side effects occurring 2 to 48 hours after infusion) included hyperhidrosis, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea.Hypersensitivity reactions in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients included livedo reticularis, irritability, retching, increased lacrimation, ventricular extrasystoles, nodal rhythm, rales, respiratory tract irritation, and cold sweat.Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions (included anaphylactic shock, respiratory failure, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, hypoxia, dyspnea, wheezing, convulsions, peripheral coldness, restlessness, nervousness, back pain, stridor, pharyngeal edema, abdominal pain, apnea, muscle spasm, conjunctivitis) have been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Hypersensitivity reactions (included anaphylaxis, headache, nausea, urticaria, dizziness, chest discomfort/pain, vomiting, hyperhidrosis, flushing/feeling hot, paresthesia, pyrexia, local swelling, diarrhea, pruritus, rash, throat tightness, fatigue, myalgia, cough, decreased oxygen saturation, tachycardia, tachypnea, muscle twitching, agitation, cyanosis, erythema, hypertension/increased blood pressure, pallor, rigors, tremor, livedo reticularis, irritability, retching, increased lacrimation, ventricular extrasystoles, nodal rhythm, rales, respiratory tract irritation, cold sweat, anaphylactic shock, respiratory failure, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, respiratory distress, hypoxia, dyspnea, bradycardia, bronchospasm, hypotension, angioedema [including tongue or lip swelling, periorbital edema, face edema], wheezing, convulsions, peripheral coldness, restlessness, nervousness, back pain, stridor, pharyngeal edema, abdominal pain, apnea, muscle spasm, conjunctivitis)Common (1% to 10%): Anaphylaxis (presented as angioedema, throat tightness, chest pain/discomfort)Postmarketing reports: Systemic and cutaneous immune-mediated reactions (including proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome secondary to membranous glomerulonephritis, ulcerative and necrotizing skin lesions)[Ref]
Supraventricular tachycardia was reported in a patient with history of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.Acute cardiorespiratory failure (possibly associated with fluid overload) was reported in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients with preexisting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.[Ref]

The most common side effects that required intervention in clinical trials in infantile-onset Pompe disease were infusion reactions (defined as side effects occurring during or within 2 hours after infusion; 51%) and included rash, fever, urticaria, flushing, decreased oxygen saturation, cough, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension, increased blood pressure, irritability, pallor, pruritus, retching, tremor, hypotension, rigors, vomiting, cyanosis, agitation, bronchospasm, erythema, face edema, feeling hot, headache, hyperhidrosis, increased lacrimation, livedo reticularis, nausea, periorbital edema, restlessness, wheezing, cardiac arrest, bradycardia, angioedema, pharyngeal edema, peripheral edema, chest pain, chest discomfort, dyspnea, muscle spasm, fatigue, respiratory distress, throat tightness, and conjunctivitis.  Infusion reactions were reported more often in antibody-positive patients, especially those with high antibody titers.Recurrent reactions consisting of influenza-like illness or a combination of events (e.g., pyrexia, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, pain, fatigue) after infusion generally lasted for 1 to 3 days.Severe and serious infusion reactions (including cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, apnea, stridor, pharyngeal edema, peripheral edema, chest pain, chest discomfort, muscle spasm, fatigue, conjunctivitis) have been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
