Applies to mercaptopurine: oral suspension, oral tablet
Hematologic effects including myelosuppression have been reported.  Myelosuppression is the most frequent adverse reaction reported with the use of mercaptopurine (the active ingredient contained in Purinethol)   Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia have also been reported frequently.[Ref]
Hyperuricemia may occur as a consequence of rapid cell lysis.  Adverse effects may be minimized by increasing hydration, urine alkalinization, and the prophylactic administration of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (such as allopurinol).[Ref]
Renal effects including hyperuricemia have been reported.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal effects including intestinal ulceration have been reported.  Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia have been infrequently reported during initial administration.  Mild diarrhea and sprue-like symptoms have been reported occasionally.  Oral lesions have been reported rarely.  An increased risk of pancreatitis may be associated with the investigational use of mercaptopurine (the active ingredient contained in Purinethol) in inflammatory bowel disease.[Ref]
The mild diarrhea and sprue-like symptoms are not necessarily related to the mercaptopurine. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations.[Ref]
Hepatic effects including a small number of deaths which may have been attributed to hepatic necrosis have been reported.[Ref]
Dermatologic effects have included skin rashes, alopecia, and hyperpigmentation.[Ref]
Genitourinary side effects including oligospermia have been reported.[Ref]
Other effects including drug fever have been reported very rarely.[Ref]
Before the drug fever is assumed to be caused by mercaptopurine, the clinician should exclude more common causes of pyrexia such as sepsis in patients with acute leukemia.[Ref]
Oncologic side effects have included hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.
