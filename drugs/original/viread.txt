Applies to tenofovir: oral powder, oral tablet
During controlled clinical trials, the most common side effects reported with tenofovir (the active ingredient contained in Viread) disoproxil fumarate (DF) in HIV-1-infected patients included rash, diarrhea, headache, pain, depression, asthenia, and nausea.  The most common side effects associated with this drug in combination with other antiretrovirals have included mild to moderate gastrointestinal events (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and flatulence) in therapy-experienced patients and mild to moderate gastrointestinal events and dizziness in therapy-naive patients.  About 1% of patients in clinical trials discontinued therapy due to gastrointestinal side effects.During controlled clinical trials, the most common side effects reported with tenofovir DF in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and compensated liver disease included nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, back pain, and skin rash.  In patients with chronic HBV and decompensated liver disease, the most common side effects reported during a controlled trial included abdominal pain, nausea, insomnia, pruritus, vomiting, dizziness, and pyrexia.[Ref]

Rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, muscular weakness, and myopathy may occur as a result of proximal renal tubulopathy.Rhabdomyolysis, muscular weakness, and myopathy have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Death due to progression of liver disease has been reported in 4% of patients with chronic HBV and decompensated liver disease (n=45).On-treatment ALT or hepatic flares have been reported in patients with chronic HBV.  In general, ALT flares occurred within the first 4 to 8 weeks of therapy, accompanied by decreases in HBV-DNA levels, and resolved within 4 to 8 weeks without changes to therapy.Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in patients with hepatitis B after discontinuation of this drug.Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (including fatal cases) have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs.Hepatic steatosis and hepatitis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]

A confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL was reported in 9% of patients with chronic HBV and decompensated liver disease (n=45); however, since tenofovir (the active ingredient contained in Viread) and decompensated liver disease may have an impact on renal function, the contribution of tenofovir to renal impairment in these patients is difficult to ascertain.Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after this drug was stopped; however, decreased CrCl did not completely resolve in some patients after stopping tenofovir DF.  Rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures), hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, and hypophosphatemia may occur as a result of proximal renal tubulopathy.Renal failure, acute renal failure, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, increased creatinine, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and acute tubular necrosis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
