The most commonly reported adverse effect was bleeding, including life threatening and fatal bleeding.
In the COMMIT study (n=45,852), the incidence of major non-cerebral or cerebral bleeding was 0.6% in clopidogrel plus aspirin treated patients, with 0.4% classified as major non-cerebral (0.2% fatal) and 0.2% as hemorrhagic stroke (0.2% fatal).  Non-major noncerebral bleeding or any noncerebral bleeding occurred in 3.6% and 3.9% of patients receiving this drug plus aspirin, respectively.  Major bleeds were defined as cerebral bleeds or non-cerebral bleeds thought to have caused death or that required transfusion.  In the CURE study (n=12,562), the incidence of fatal bleeding (0.2%) and intracranial hemorrhage (0.1%) was the same between clopidogrel with aspirin and placebo with aspirin groups.
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Fatal bleeding, eosinophilia, leucopenia, increased bleeding time, thrombocytopeniaRare (0.01% to 0.1%): NeutropeniaVery rare (less than 0.01%): Decreased platelet countPostmarketing reports: Serious cases of bleeding (mainly skin), hemarthrosis, hematoma, hemorrhage of operative wound, fatal hemorrhage (intracranial, gastrointestinal, and retroperitoneal), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), acquired hemophilia A, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, anemia
In the CAPRIE study (n=19,185), gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients taking clopidogrel compared to 2.7% taking aspirin.  Bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0.7% clopidogrel-treated and 1.1% aspirin-treated patients.
Common (1% to 10%): Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, dyspepsia, diarrhea, nausea, gastritisUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Vomiting, flatulence, constipation, gastric, peptic, or duodenal ulcerRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Retroperitoneal hemorrhagePostmarketing reports: Colitis (ulcerative or lymphocytic), pancreatitis, stomatitis

Common (1% to 10%): DepressionPostmarketing reports: Hallucinations, confusion
Common (1% to 10%): Upper respiratory tract infection, dyspnea, rhinitis, coughing, bronchitis, epistaxisPostmarketing reports: Bronchospasm, interstitial pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, respiratory tract bleeding (hemoptysis, pulmonary hemorrhage)
Common (1% to 10%): Rash, purpura, pruritus, bruisingPostmarketing reports: Maculopapular, erythematous, or exfoliative rash, urticaria, bullous dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), eczema, lichen planus
In CAPRIE (n=19,185), 4.2% of patients receiving clopidogrel developed a rash compared to 3.5% in the aspirin group.  In CURE (n=12,562), 1.3% treated with clopidogrel and aspirin compared to 1.1% placebo, as well as 0.7% of patients in CLARITY (n=3491) reported a rash.  Drug discontinuation due to skin disorders in CAPRIE was 0.8% and in CURE 0.4% of patients.
