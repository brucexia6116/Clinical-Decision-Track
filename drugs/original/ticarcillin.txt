Applies to ticarcillin: injectable powder for injection
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pseudomembranous colitis.[Ref]
Local side effects have included injection site pain and induration.  Vein irritation and phlebitis may occur when undiluted ticarcillin is injected directly.[Ref]
Hypersensitivity reactions have included skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, drug fever, and anaphylaxis.[Ref]
Some studies show a positive correlation between the degree of hypokalemia, the dose of ticarcillin, and the serum BUN/creatinine ratio, suggesting dehydration and higher doses are risk factors for the development of ticarcillin-associated hypokalemia.[Ref]
Metabolic abnormalities have included hypernatremia and hypokalemia.[Ref]
Hematologic side effects have included anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia.[Ref]
Hepatic side effects have included elevations of SGOT and SGPT.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects may include convulsion or neuromuscular excitability with high doses.[Ref]
