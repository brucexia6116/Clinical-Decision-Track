If any of the following side effects occur while taking fibrin sealant topical, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
General side effects have been reported including rare reports of serious adverse events such as paralysis and other compressive complications possibly related to the use of fibrin sealant in combination with resorbable hemostatic agents.  There have also been rare reports of fatalities following the misadministration of topical thrombin.
Hypersensitivity side effects such as anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions including shock have been reported rarely.
Cardiovascular side effects including tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, and thromboembolic complications have been reported rarely.
Respiratory side effects including severe dyspnea have been reported rarely.
Dermatologic side effects including flush, urticaria, and pruritus have been reported rarely.
Gastrointestinal side effects including nausea have been reported rarely.
A D-dimer is a fragment produced during the degradation of a clot.  Postoperatively increased D-dimers may result at least partly from the degradation of fibrin sealant.
Other side effects including increased D-dimer levels have been reported in a clinical study on cardiovascular surgery, but did not exceed values reported in the literature occurring after this type of surgery.
