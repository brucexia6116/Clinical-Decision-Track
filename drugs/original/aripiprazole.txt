Other dosage forms:
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by aripiprazole. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking aripiprazole:

Some of the side effects that can occur with aripiprazole may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:

The most frequently reported adverse effects in adult clinical trials of the immediate-release products included nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, dizziness, akathisia, anxiety, insomnia, and restlessness.  The most common adverse reactions in pediatric clinical trials were somnolence, headache, vomiting, extrapyramidal disorder, fatigue, increased appetite, insomnia, nausea, nasopharyngitis, and weight gain.  The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials of the extended-release IM formulation included increased weight, akathisia, injection site pain, and sedation.[Ref]

Elderly patients (mean = 84 years old) enrolled in placebo-controlled studies examining the use of aripiprazole for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis showed an increased incidence of cerebrovascular side effects, e.g.  stroke and transient ischemia attacks, including fatalities.  The incidence of these effects may be dose related.In a dose response analysis, somnolence including sedation was the only adverse reaction determined to have a dose response relationship in adult patients.  Somnolence was reported in 12.6% of adult patients with schizophrenia receiving the 30 mg dose.In pediatric patients 13 to 17 years of age, extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor displayed possible dose response relationship in patients with schizophrenia, while extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and akathisia displayed possible dose response relationship in pediatric patients with bipolar mania.  Extrapyramidal symptoms were more prevalent with use of the extended-release IM injection compared with oral formulations (18.4% versus 11.7%).  Akathisia was the most frequently observed adverse event with the extended-release IM injection; it typically starts around day 10 and lasts a median of 56 days.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Headache (up to 27%), akathisia (up to 25%), somnolence (up to 23%), extrapyramidal disorder (up to 20%)Common (1% to 10%): Dizziness, sedation, tremor, drooling, dystonia, feeling jittery, disturbance in attention, abnormal coordinationUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Speech disorder, parkinsonism, memory impairment, cogwheel rigidity, cerebrovascular accident, hypokinesia, tardive dyskinesia, hypotonia, myoclonus, hypertonia, akinesia, bradykinesiaRare (less than 0.1%): Grand Mal convulsion, choreoathetosis, dysgeusiaVery rare (less than 0.01%): Oromandibular dystoniaPostmarketing reports: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, speech disorder[Ref]

Reports of diabetes mellitus included increases in blood insulin, decreases in carbohydrate tolerance, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, and glycosuria.  Analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adult patients primarily with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder revealed a mean increase in fasting blood glucose of 4.4 mg/dL with a median exposure of 25 days.  This was not significantly different from placebo (+2.5 mg/dL, median exposure 22 days).  A pooled analysis in pediatric patients revealed a mean change in fasting glucose of 2.4 mg/dL compared with 0.1 mg/dL in placebo treated patients following 12 weeks of therapy.  In long-term, open label schizophrenia studies with aripiprazole lauroxil, 14% of patients with HbA1c less than 5.7% at baseline developed levels of 5.7% or higher post-baseline.Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics.  Analyses of patients receiving this drug are limited due to the small number of patients who received this drug for extended periods in the clinical trials.  In long-term, open label schizophrenia studies with aripiprazole lauroxil, shifts in fasting total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides from normal to high were reported in 1%, 1%, and 8% of patients.   Weight gain has been observed in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics.  Analysis of 13 placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adult patients primarily with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder revealed a mean change in weight of +0.3 kg (n=1673) with a median exposure of 21 to 25 days compared with a decrease of 0.1 kg in placebo treated patients (n=1100).  A pooled analysis in pediatric patients (10 to 17 years) revealed a mean change in weight of +5.8 kg (n=62) compared with +1.4 kg (n=13) in placebo treated patients following 12 weeks of therapy.  In a 12-week, fixed dose schizophrenia study in patients receiving with aripiprazole lauroxil, IM weight gain of 7% or greater from baseline was observed in 10% (n=207) and 9% (n=208) of patients receiving 441 mg and 882 mg IM, respectively.  During clinical trials, the percentage of pediatric and adolescent patients by indication with weight gain of 7% or more of body weight compared to placebo was (5.2% vs 1.6%), (26.3% vs 7.1%), and (20% vs 7.6%), respectively for schizophrenia/bipolar mania, irritability associated with autistic disorder, and Tourette's disorder, respectively.  Treatment durations were 4 to 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and 8 to 10 weeks, respectively.[Ref]

Collective data from 17 placebo-controlled clinical studies involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death 1.6 to 1.7 times greater in the drug-treated patient than in the placebo-treated patient.  The average length of duration for the trials was 10 weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.  Although aripiprazole was not included in these studies, the consistent findings across all three relevant chemical classes support the opinion that these findings are likely to be applicable to all atypical antipsychotic agents.  Aripiprazole is not indicated for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.[Ref]
