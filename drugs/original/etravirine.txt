Applies to etravirine: oral tablet
The safety report of etravirine is based on 599 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced patients receiving 200 mg twice daily in combination with background regimen (BR).  The median exposure was 52.3 weeks.  Discontinuation due to side effects occurred in 5.2% of patients using etravirine.  The most common side effects of moderate to severe intensity reported with etravirine and BR, regardless of causality, were peripheral neuropathy and rash.  A total of 2.2% of HIV-1-infected patients in Phase 3 trials receiving etravirine discontinued due to rash.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Rash (all intensities: 16.9%; at least moderate intensity: 10%)Common (1% to 10%): Less than 2% (at least moderate intensity): Dry skin, face swelling, hyperhidrosis, lipohypertrophy, night sweats, prurigoUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Erythema multiforme (at least moderate intensity: up to 0.5%)Rare (less than 0.1%): Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiformeFrequency not reported: Contact dermatitis, erythema, pruritusPostmarketing reports: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (fatal cases)[Ref]
During clinical trials, rash generally was mild to moderate, occurred chiefly in the second week of therapy, and was infrequent after the fourth week.  Rash usually resolved within 1 to 2 weeks on continued use of the drug.  The incidence of rash was higher in women taking etravirine (at least moderate severity: 15%) compared to men (at least moderate severity: 9.5%).  Discontinuation due to rash occurred in 5% of women compared to 1.9% of men.  Patients with a history of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-related rash did not appear to be at increased risk.Erythema multiforme has been reported in no more than 0.5% of patients in other trials.[Ref]

Grade 2 or higher abnormalities representing a worsening from baseline of AST, ALT, and total bilirubin have been reported in 27.8%, 25%, and 7.1%, respectively, in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and/or C virus as compared to 6.7%, 7.5%, and 1.8% reported in non-coinfected patients.[Ref]
