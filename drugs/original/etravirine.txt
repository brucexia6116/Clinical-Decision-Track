The safety report of etravirine is based on 599 HIV-1-infected, treatment-experienced patients receiving 200 mg twice daily in combination with background regimen (BR).  The median exposure was 52.3 weeks.  Discontinuation due to side effects occurred in 5.2% of patients using etravirine.  The most common side effects of moderate to severe intensity reported with etravirine and BR, regardless of causality, were peripheral neuropathy and rash.  A total of 2.2% of HIV-1-infected patients in Phase 3 trials receiving etravirine discontinued due to rash.
Very common (10% or more): Rash (all intensities: 16.9%; at least moderate intensity: 10%)Common (1% to 10%): Less than 2% (at least moderate intensity): Dry skin, face swelling, hyperhidrosis, lipohypertrophy, night sweats, prurigoUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Erythema multiforme (at least moderate intensity: up to 0.5%)Rare (less than 0.1%): Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiformeFrequency not reported: Contact dermatitis, erythema, pruritusPostmarketing reports: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (fatal cases)
During clinical trials, rash generally was mild to moderate, occurred chiefly in the second week of therapy, and was infrequent after the fourth week.  Rash usually resolved within 1 to 2 weeks on continued use of the drug.  The incidence of rash was higher in women taking etravirine (at least moderate severity: 15%) compared to men (at least moderate severity: 9.5%).  Discontinuation due to rash occurred in 5% of women compared to 1.9% of men.  Patients with a history of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-related rash did not appear to be at increased risk.Erythema multiforme has been reported in no more than 0.5% of patients in other trials.

Acquired lipodystrophy has been reported in no more than 0.5% of patients in other trials.
Very common (10% or more): Worsening from baseline of AST (at least moderate intensity: 27.8% coinfected patients), worsening from baseline of ALT (at least moderate intensity: 25% coinfected patients)Common (1% to 10%): Worsening from baseline of ALT (at least moderate intensity: 7.5% non-coinfected patients), worsening from baseline of total bilirubin (at least moderate intensity: 7.1% coinfected patients), worsening from baseline of AST (at least moderate intensity: 6.7% non-coinfected patients), elevated ALT (Grade 2: 6%; Grade 3: 3%; Grade 4: 1%), elevated AST (Grade 2: 6%; Grade 3: 3%), worsening from baseline of total bilirubin (at least moderate intensity: 1.8% non-coinfected patients); Less than 2% (at least moderate intensity): Cytolytic hepatitis, hepatic steatosis, hepatitis, hepatic failure, hepatomegalyUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Elevated AST (Grade 4: less than 1%)
Grade 2 or higher abnormalities representing a worsening from baseline of AST, ALT, and total bilirubin have been reported in 27.8%, 25%, and 7.1%, respectively, in patients coinfected with hepatitis B and/or C virus as compared to 6.7%, 7.5%, and 1.8% reported in non-coinfected patients.
