Serious side effects were reported in 0.3% to 2% of subjects using this drug with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin and in 0% to 3% using placebo with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.  During the first 12 weeks of therapy, the most common side effects were nausea, rash, pruritus, dyspnea, increased blood bilirubin, and photosensitivity reaction.  This drug was discontinued due to side effects in 0.9% to 2% of subjects using this drug with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin.In a clinical trial, the most common side effects reported during 12 weeks therapy with this drug in combination with sofosbuvir (without ribavirin) were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia, and pruritus.The manufacturer product information for coadministered hepatitis C virus (HCV) antiviral drugs should be consulted.[Ref]
