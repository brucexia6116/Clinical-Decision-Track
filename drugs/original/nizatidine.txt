A 16-year-old female with schizophrenia experienced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) coincident with nizatidine therapy.  She had been receiving quetiapine and paroxetine for schizophrenia and depression and developed EPS after taking nizatidine 150 mg twice daily for weight loss.  Over the ensuing 4 weeks, her weight decreased substantially.  Because of these initial positive effects, the nizatidine dosage was increased to 300 mg twice daily.  Within 4 days of this dosage increase, the patient started pacing and could not sit still.  Examination revealed moderate akithisia and mild parkinsonism.  Due to concerns about EPS, the nizatidine dosage was decreased to the original 150 mg twice daily.  Over the next five days, the patients EPS resolved .[Ref]
