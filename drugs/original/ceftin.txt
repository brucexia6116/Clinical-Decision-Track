Common side effects of Ceftin include: diarrhea.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Cefuroxime (the active ingredient contained in Ceftin) was generally well tolerated.  The side effects most commonly reported with the parenteral formulation have included neutropenia, eosinophilia, transient liver enzyme/bilirubin elevations, and injection site reactions.  The side effects most commonly reported with the oral formulations have included Candida overgrowth, eosinophilia, headache, dizziness, gastrointestinal disturbances, and transient liver enzyme elevations.
Side effects may be more likely and more severe in patients with liver disease and/or renal dysfunction.

A 90-year-old man, with no history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia, was administered 750 mg cefuroxime (the active ingredient contained in Ceftin) axetil IM for urinary tract infection.  About 10 minutes after the injection, the patient developed chest pain and pruritic skin rashes.  Kounis syndrome type I variant was diagnosed secondary to the drug.  Five days after stopping the drug, the patient's symptoms had resolved.
