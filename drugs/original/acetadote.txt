The most common adverse events were anaphylactoid reaction, nausea, vomiting, flushing, and skin rash.
Anaphylactoid symptoms include airway obstruction (bronchospasm), angioedema, dyspnea, hypotension, shock, tachycardia, urticaria, and injection site reaction (including rash).  These are most common either during, or at the end of the loading dose infusion, and may be dose related.  Careful monitoring is recommended.
