Metabolic side effects have been reported rarely.  Hyperkalemia may cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias, and can occur even when renal function is normal.  Patients should not use potassium-rich salt substitutes without the advice of their healthcare professional during potassium citrate (the active ingredient contained in Urocit-K) therapy.  Long-term therapy can result in metabolic alkalosis.[Ref]
Signs of hyperkalemia include muscle weakness (including frank skeletal muscle and diaphragm paralysis), peaked T waves on the ECG, and cardiac arrhythmias.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects have been reported the most frequently.  These have included nausea, vomiting, and epigastric or abdominal pain (in 3% to 17% of patients).  GI side effects may be lessened by taking the drug with meals.There are numerous reports of GI ulceration and rare reports of gastric or small bowel obstruction associated with the use of solid potassium salt preparations.  Patients at higher risk of GI lesions include the elderly and patients with scleroderma, diabetes mellitus, mitral valve replacement, cardiomegaly, esophageal stricture, or impaired GI motility or diverticulae.[Ref]
