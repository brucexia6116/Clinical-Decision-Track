Some nedocromil side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Gastrointestinal side effects have included unpleasant taste which was reported in approximately 13% of patients receiving nedocromil and resulted in drug withdrawal in up to 3%.  Less commonly, nedocromil has caused nausea and vomiting (2% to 4%).
Throat irritation may be relieved by drinking water before and after inhalation of nedocromil.  Use of a beta-2 agonist prior to nedocromil inhalation may relieve cough and bronchospasm.
Respiratory side effects have included cough and throat irritation in 6% to 7% of patients treated with nedocromil.  Bronchospasm has been induced in 5% of patients.
Nervous system side effects have included headache in up to 6% of patients treated.  Less commonly dizziness has been reported.
Hepatic side effects have included elevations of liver function tests (SGPT) in approximately 3% of patients treated with nedocromil.
