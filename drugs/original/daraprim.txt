Applies to pyrimethamine: compounding powder, oral tablet
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, and atrophic glossitis, particularly with high doses.  Gastrointestinal intolerance may be minimized by administering pyrimethamine (the active ingredient contained in Daraprim) with food.[Ref]
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported when pyrimethamine (the active ingredient contained in Daraprim) is administered with a sulfonamide.  These reactions may be severe and include erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Lyell's syndrome, hepatitis, anaphylaxis, and pulmonary reactions.  Fatal reactions have been estimated to occur in one of 11,000 to 25,000 patients treated.  Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported with pyrimethamine/clindamycin combinations and are usually limited to maculopapular rashes.[Ref]
Hematologic side effects have occurred, especially when large doses of pyrimethamine (the active ingredient contained in Daraprim) are administered.  Thrombocytopenia, megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and fatalities have been reported.[Ref]
Nervous system toxicity is problematic with higher dosages of pyrimethamine (the active ingredient contained in Daraprim)   Ataxia, tremors, and seizures may occur.[Ref]
Respiratory side effects have rarely included pulmonary eosinophilia.[Ref]
Cardiovascular side effects have included arrhythmias, particularly with high doses.[Ref]
Metabolic side effects have included hyperphenylalaninemia, particularly when pyrimethamine (the active ingredient contained in Daraprim) is given in combination with a sulfonamide.[Ref]
Oncologic side effects have included two reports of malignancy; both were associated with pyrimethamine (the active ingredient contained in Daraprim) treatment for toxoplasmosis: 1 patient developed chronic granulocytic leukemia after 2 years of therapy and 1 patient developed reticulum cell sarcoma after 14 months of therapy.  Animal studies have revealed increased lung tumors with intraperitoneal administration.[Ref]
