This drug was generally well tolerated.  Local side effects (after IV or IM injection) were most common.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, loose stoolsFrequency not reported: Nausea, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea[Ref]
The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms has been reported during or after antimicrobial therapy.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Rash, pruritusFrequency not reported: Vesicular eruptions/vesiculation, erythema multiforme, urticaria, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reactions with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), petechial rash/purpura, exanthematous pustulosis, bullous dermatosis, erythema nodosum, exanthems, exfoliative dermatitis, Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction[Ref]
An increased incidence of rash has been reported in cystic fibrosis patients.DRESS has been reported, particularly with piperacillin-tazobactam.Petechial rash or purpura due to thrombocytopenia has been reported.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Thrombophlebitis, injection site pain, injection site induration, injection site erythemaFrequency not reported: Ecchymosis, deep vein thrombosis, hematomas[Ref]
Thrombophlebitis was more likely when insufficiently diluted solution was injected into the vein.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Drug feverFrequency not reported: Fever, edema, fatigue, decreased serum potassium levels, superinfection (including candidiasis), hemorrhagic manifestations[Ref]
An increased incidence of fever has been reported in cystic fibrosis patients.Patients with liver disease or those receiving cytotoxic therapy or diuretics have reported decreased serum potassium levels with high doses of this drug.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (some leading to shock and fatalities)[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, eosinophilia, bleeding disorders, positive Coombs tests, hemorrhage/bleeding, decreased prothrombin time, platelet dysfunction, prolonged bleeding times[Ref]
Risk factors for reversible leukopenia (neutropenia) included prolonged therapy with high doses or concomitant drugs that cause this effect.[Ref]
Neuromuscular excitability and convulsions have been reported when higher than recommended doses were given IV.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Headache, dizziness, seizures/convulsions, prolonged muscle relaxation, paralysis, neurotoxicity, encephalopathy, neuromuscular excitability[Ref]
Drug-induced interstitial nephritis is a rare but potentially serious side effect of all penicillins.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Elevated serum creatinine, elevated BUN, interstitial nephritis, renal failure[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Elevated liver enzymes (LDH, AST, ALT), hyperbilirubinemia, hepatotoxicity, cholestatic hepatitis[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Hypokalemia, electrolyte disturbances, acid-base disturbances[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Epistaxis
