As well as its needed effects, peginterferon alfa-2a may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some peginterferon alfa-2a side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
During hepatitis C studies, at least 1 serious side effect was reported in 10% of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients and 19% of CHC patients coinfected with HIV.  The most common serious side effect was bacterial infection (including sepsis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pyelonephritis, pneumonia).  Other serious side effects were suicide, suicidal ideation, psychosis, aggression, anxiety, drug abuse and drug overdose, angina, hepatic dysfunction, fatty liver, cholangitis, arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, autoimmune phenomena (e.g., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), peripheral neuropathy, aplastic anemia, peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, colitis, corneal ulcer, pulmonary embolism, coma, myositis, cerebral hemorrhage, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, psychotic disorder, and hallucination.  The most common side effects were psychiatric reactions (including depression, insomnia, irritability, anxiety), influenza-like symptoms (such as fatigue, pyrexia, myalgia, headache, rigors), anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, arthralgias, injection site reactions, alopecia, and pruritus.  Psychiatric disorders, influenza-like syndrome (e.g., lethargy, fatigue, headache), dermatologic disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and laboratory abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia) were the most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy.In clinical trials, patients with chronic hepatitis B had similar side effects as CHC patients using peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy, except for exacerbations of hepatitis.
