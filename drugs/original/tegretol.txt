As well as its needed effects, carbamazepine (the active ingredient contained in Tegretol) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some carbamazepine side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (29%), vomiting (18%), constipation (10%)Very rare (less than 0.01%): Colitis, glossitis, stomatitis, pancreatitisFrequency not reported: Dryness of the mouth, with suppositories occasional rectal irritation may occur, diarrhea, oral ulcerationPostmarketing reports: Gastric distress, abdominal pain, anorexia
A single case of chemical pancreatitis has been reported in association with carbamazepine intoxication.
Carbamazepine increases the rate of T4 and T3 metabolism and may lead to hypothyroidism in patients with hypothyroidism who are being treated with T4.  Carbamazepine may also cause a 20% to 40% decrease in serum total and free T4 concentrations and a smaller decrease in serum total and free T3 concentrations in patients who have no thyroid disease.Chronic administration of carbamazepine (the active ingredient contained in Tegretol) may increase total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels.  Carbamazepine may also transiently increase serum triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels.  One study has suggested that demeclocycline may be useful in prophylaxis of carbamazepine-induced hyponatremia.
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Increase in prolactin (with or without symptoms such as gynecomastia or galactorrhea), impaired male fertility and/or abnormal spermatogenesis, abnormal thyroid function tests (e.g., decreased L-thyroxine [FT4, T4, T3] and increased TSH)Frequency not reported: Hyponatremia, pancreatitis, lower serum testosterone, lower free androgen indexes, increased cerebrospinal fluid thyrotropin-releasing hormone levels
Very common (10% or more): LeucopeniaCommon (1% to 10%): Eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, neutropeniaRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Leukocytosis, lymphadenopathy, folic acid deficiencyVery rare (less than 0.01%): Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, megaloblastic anemia, acute intermittent porphyria, reticulocytosis, hemolytic anemiaFrequency not reported: Aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow depression, leukopenia, thrombophlebitis, thromboembolism, adenopathy
Thrombocytopenia is the most common hematologic effect of carbamazepine and may be either mild and transient or severe.  Significant decreases in white blood cell counts may occur although the values may still be within the normal range.  Often counts will return to baseline during continued therapy, and therefore, discontinuation of carbamazepine may not be necessary.  Dose reductions may also result in normalization of white blood cell counts.  Aplastic anemia has been reported (although many of the reported cases had confounding exposures to other medications).  The manufacturer reports an incidence of 2 per 1,000,000 patients for aplastic anemia and 6 per 1,000,000 patients for agranulocytosis.  Cases of reticulocytosis have been reported rarely in association with carbamazepine therapy as well.  In addition, cases of hemolytic anemia and erythroid arrest have been reported.Both humoral and nonimmune mechanisms have been implicated in the etiology of carbamazepine-induced bone marrow suppression.
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Disturbances of cardiac conductionVery rare (less than 0.01%): Bradycardia, arrhythmias, AV-block with syncope, collapse, congestive heart failure, hypertension or hypotension, aggravation of coronary artery disease, thrombophlebitis, thromboembolism
Most of the cases of cardiovascular effects reported have occurred in patients receiving carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia.  The reported effects included congestive heart failure, edema, hypotension, syncope and arrhythmias.  In general, the doses were titrated quickly because of severe pain.  Many of the doses were higher than those used to treat epilepsy.  Many of the reported cardiovascular effects resolved after discontinuation of carbamazepine.Increased sympathetic activity in the setting of seizure-induced hypoxia could predispose a patient to sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).
Very common (10% or more): Dizziness (44%), somnolence (32%), ataxia (15%) Common (1% to 10%): Headache, tremor, vertigoUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Abnormal involuntary movements (tremor, asterixis, dystonia, tics)Rare (less than 0.1%): Choreoathetotic disorders, orofacial dyskinesia, oculomotor disturbances, speech disorders (e.g., dysarthria or slurred speech), peripheral neuritis, paresthesia, paretic symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndromeFrequency not reported: Drowsiness, fatigue, fever and chills
Rigidity and oculogyric crises have been reported.  Euphoria has also been reported and has led to abuse of carbamazepine in some patients.  Impairment of psychomotor function has been noted in association with use of the liquid suspension of carbamazepine.  Additionally, impaired cognition, exacerbations of focal seizures and asterixis have been reported in association with carbamazepine treatment.  One case of a lingual-facial-buccal extrapyramidal reaction has also been described.One study has suggested that gradual withdrawal of carbamazepine over ten days results in significantly fewer generalized tonic-clonic seizures compared to rapid withdrawal over four days.One study has suggested that the epoxide metabolite of carbamazepine may be responsible for the occasional occurrence of seizure exacerbations in patients receiving carbamazepine.
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): A delayed multi-organ hypersensitivity disorder (of serum sickness type) with fever, skin rashes, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, disorders mimicking lymphoma, arthralgia, leucopenia, eosinophilia, hepato-splenomegaly and abnormal liver function tests, occurring in various combinations, other organs may also be affected (e.g., lungs, kidneys, pancreas, myocardium, colon)Very rare (less than 0.01%): Aseptic meningitis (with myoclonus and peripheral eosinophilia), anaphylactic reaction, angioedemaFrequency not reported: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions occurring days, weeks, or months after initiating treatment
Rash and pruritus often resolve after discontinuation of carbamazepine therapy.  Both cases of lupus-like syndrome resolved after discontinuation of carbamazepine.  Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and a mononucleosis-like syndrome have also been reported.
Very common (10% or more): Elevated gamma-GT (due to hepatic enzyme induction) usually not clinically relevantCommon (1% to 10%): Elevated alkaline phosphataseUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Elevated transaminasesRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Cholestatic and hepatocellular jaundice, hepatitis of cholestatic, parenchymal (hepatocellular), or mixed typeVery rare (less than 0.01%): Granulomatous hepatitis, hepatic failureFrequency not reported: Liver function test abnormalities, variegate porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda
Alterations in liver function tests may progress to hepatotoxicity including cholangitis, granuloma formation, fever and hepatocellular necrosis.  Discontinuation of carbamazepine often results in improvement in laboratory abnormalities and liver injury.
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Interstitial nephritis, renal failure, renal dysfunction (including albuminuria, hematuria, oliguria, and elevated BUN/azotemia)
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Pulmonary hypersensitivity (characterized by fever, dyspnea, pneumonitis or pneumonia), pulmonary embolism
Very common (10% or more): Allergic skin reactions, urticariaCommon (1% to 10%): Pruritus, rash, paresthesiaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Exfoliative dermatitis, erythrodermaRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndromeVery rare (less than 0.01%): Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), photosensitivity, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, alterations in skin pigmentation, purpura, acne, sweating, alopecia, hirsutism, unusual bruising, pruritic and erythematous rashes, diaphoresis, onychomycosis, dermatitisFrequency not reported: Psoriasiform eruption
Dangerous, sometimes fatal skin reactions (Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis), that can be caused by carbamazepine therapy are significantly more common in patients with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele, HLA-B 1502.  This allele occurs almost exclusively in patients with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, including South Asian Indians.  Patients with ancestry from areas in which HLA-B 1502 is present should be screened for the HLA-B 1502 allele before starting treatment with carbamazepine.  If these individuals test positive, carbamazepine should not be started unless the expected benefit clearly outweighs the increased risk of serious skin reactions.  Patients who have been taking carbamazepine for more than a few months without developing skin reactions are at low risk of these events ever developing from carbamazepine.  This is true for patients of any ethnicity or genotype, including patients who test positive for HLA-B 1502.
Common (1% to 10%): Diplopia, accommodation disorders (blurred vision)Very rare (less than 0.01%): Lens opacities, conjunctivitisPostmarketing reports: Diplopia, oculomotor disturbances, nystagmus, photosensitivity, visual hallucinations, scattered punctate cortical lens opacities, overall impairment of the chromatic and achromatic systems, increased intraocular pressure
