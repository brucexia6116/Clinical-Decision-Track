In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by ciprofloxacin. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking ciprofloxacin:
Some of the side effects that can occur with ciprofloxacin may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to ciprofloxacin: intravenous solution, oral powder for reconstitution, oral tablet, oral tablet extended release
The most common side effects (from clinical trials of all formulations, doses, durations of therapy, and indications) were nausea, diarrhea, abnormal liver function tests, vomiting, and rash.  The most common side effects reported with the IV formulation were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, injection and infusion site reactions, rash, and increased transaminases (transient).[Ref]
Antibiotic-associated colitis with possible fatal outcome was reported very rarely.The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms has been reported during or after antimicrobial treatment.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dyspepsiaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Abdominal pains/discomfort, gastrointestinal (GI) pains, flatulenceRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Elevated amylase, antibiotic-associated colitis, pancreatitisFrequency not reported: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, constipation, GI bleeding, ileus, intestinal perforation, dry mouth, oral ulceration, epigastric pain, dysphagia, elevated lipase, painful oral mucosa, heartburn, acid reflux, aggravated irritable bowel syndrome, lower abdominal painPostmarketing reports: GI candidiasis, oral candidiasis, pseudomembranous colitis[Ref]
Photosensitivity was seen most often when patients were exposed to intense sun (e.g., as when used to treat or prevent travelers' diarrhea).A 27-year-old woman with mild systemic erythematosus developed toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) after starting a second oral course of this drug after a prior 5-day course.  She developed a rash, high fever, and diarrhea after taking the 2nd dose and presented with diffuse rash, epidermal sloughing of 60% of the skin, desquamation of the lips, shock, and respiratory distress.  She died on the 28th hospital day of TEN, right ventricular failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.  As of 2003, 9 cases of TEN, including 5 fatalities, had been reported in the literature.Erythema nodosum, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (potentially life-threatening), and TEN (potentially life-threatening) have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): RashUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pruritus, urticariaRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Angioedema, photosensitivity reactions, sweating/hyperhidrosis, petechiae, blisteringVery rare (less than 0.01%): Erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (potentially life-threatening), toxic epidermal necrolysis (potentially life-threatening)Frequency not reported: Exfoliative dermatitis, purpura, burning, phototoxicity reaction, dry skin, maculopapular rash, skin disorder, vesiculobullous rash, erythema, hyperpigmentation, cutaneous candidiasis, bullous pemphigoid, vesicles, lobular panniculitis, photoinduced acute exanthematous pustulosis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)Postmarketing reports: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, fixed eruption[Ref]
Seizures have been reported in 2 patients given this drug and foscarnet.  The temporal association between the onset of seizures and drug administration suggests a possible drug interaction; causal relationship was not established in either case.  Both drugs are individually epileptogenic; concurrent use may potentiate risk of seizures.Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy (affecting small and/or large axons) resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness have been reported.One survey reported 11 cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with this drug.  The severity ranged from mild and reversible to severe and persistent.  In 1 case, a 44-year-old female developed numbness, allodynia, hypoesthesia, tremors, electrical and diffuse burning sensations, twitching, disorientation, visual impairment, nausea, temperature intolerance, rash, and palpitations; she remained disabled after 29 months.Nystagmus, anosmia, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, hypertonia, intracranial hypertension, and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]

Depression and psychotic reactions (both potentially culminating in self-injurious behavior such as suicidal ideations/thoughts and attempted or completed suicide) have been reported.Agitation, confusion, and toxic psychosis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Crystalluria has been reported in patients with alkaline urine and did not necessarily lead to nephrotoxicity.  At physiological urinary pH, the risk of crystalluria was considered minor.Vaginal candidiasis has also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Vaginal candidiasisRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Hematuria, crystalluriaFrequency not reported: Albuminuria, cylindruria, frequent urination, hemorrhagic cystitis, vaginitis, dysmenorrhea, candiduria, polyuria, urethral bleeding, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, fungal vaginosis, bacterial vaginitis, dysuria, abnormal urine odor, female genital pruritus, vaginal infection, urinary frequency, micturition urgency, vaginal pruritus[Ref]
Local IV site reactions occurred more often if the infusion time was 30 minutes or less.  These reactions have appeared as local skin reactions and resolved quickly when infusion was completed.Injection site irritation and induration have been reported with IV infusion time 30 minutes or less (instead of the recommended 1 hour) or when a small vein in the back of the hand was used.[Ref]

Arthropathy has primarily been a concern in pediatric patients; however, at least 1 case was described in an adult cystic fibrosis patient receiving this drug.  Although cystic fibrosis arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy typically occur in 7% to 8% of cystic fibrosis adults and adolescents, the arthropathy exhibited in this patient did not resemble either.  Several elements in its presentation strongly supported the diagnosis of ciprofloxacin-induced arthropathy, such as: a consistent time of onset with other reported cases of suspected quinolone-induced arthropathy (usually 3 weeks after starting therapy); a lack of history of arthralgia in the patient; reoccurrence upon rechallenge; and resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of therapy (usually 2 weeks after therapy stopped).Tendinitis with subsequent tendon rupture has been documented in numerous case reports.  One patient with chronic renal failure developed bilateral Achilles tendon rupture after 4 days of ciprofloxacin therapy.  Although renal transplant patients and those with end-stage renal disease tend to have an increased risk of Achilles tendinitis and rupture over the general population, quinolone use has been shown to further increase that risk (12% in quinolone-treated patients versus 7% in nonquinolone-treated patients).As of October 1994, 25 cases of Achilles tendon rupture had been reported to the US FDA.  Some ruptures have also occurred in the hand or shoulder.  Other risk factors identified included age and corticosteroid use.There had been 23 reports of tendinitis submitted to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Committee (ADRAC) between 2006 and 2008, including reports of Achilles tendinitis, tendon rupture, and tendon pain and swelling.  The reports were primarily in male patients (15 cases) older than 56 years who used this drug for 2 to 14 days.  In 19 of the reported cases, a fluoroquinolone (generally ciprofloxacin) was the primary suspect; however, details of concomitant serious medical conditions were not documented in most of the reports.Musculoskeletal side effects reported in pediatric patients included arthralgia, abnormal gait, abnormal joint exam, joint sprains, leg pain, back pain, arthrosis, bone pain, pain, myalgia, arm pain, and decreased range of motion in a joint (knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, shoulder).Myalgia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Tachycardia, vasodilatation, hypotensionRare (0.01% to 0.1%): VasculitisFrequency not reported: Angina pectoris, cardiopulmonary arrest, myocardial infarction, hypertension, palpitation, bradycardia, arrhythmia, atrial flutter, cardiac murmur, cardiovascular collapse, ventricular ectopy, ventricular bigeminy, abdominal aortic bruit, postural hypotensionPostmarketing reports: QT prolongation/ECG QT prolonged, torsade de pointes, ventricular arrhythmia[Ref]
Torsade de pointes was reported mainly in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation.Vasculitis has also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Elevated serum theophylline has been reported in patients receiving theophylline concomitantly.Gait disturbance and elevated serum potassium have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Candida infections, mycotic superinfections, pain, fever, malaise/feeling unwell, asthenia, edemaVery rare (less than 0.01%): Gait disturbance/abnormal gaitFrequency not reported: Irritability, flushing, thirst, elevated serum calcium, elevated serum potassium, elevated triglycerides, decreased serum albumin, decreased serum potassium, decreased total serum protein, elevated serum theophylline, serum phenytoin altered, chills, swelling, breast pain, achiness, weakness, fatigue, suprapubic pain, rigors, tenderness, fungal infection, increased body temperaturePostmarketing reports: Elevated serum cholesterol[Ref]

Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Renal impairment, renal failureRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Tubulointerstitial nephritisFrequency not reported: Elevated serum creatinine, renal calculi, elevated BUN, decreased BUN, abnormal kidney function, allergic interstitial nephritis, nephritis, myoglobin-associated acute kidney injury/failure[Ref]
Allergic interstitial nephritis resulting in nonoliguric renal failure has been described in numerous case reports.  Several cases included symptoms of rash, fever, and arthralgia and were accompanied by eosinophilia and eosinophiluria.  Cases of allergic interstitial nephritis often responded to short courses of corticosteroid therapy.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Visual disturbances (e.g., chromatopsia, diplopia, photopsia)Very rare (less than 0.01%): Visual color distortionsFrequency not reported: Decreased visual acuity, blurred vision, cataracts, multiple punctate lenticular opacities, eye pain[Ref]
Quinolone class antibiotics have been associated with cataracts and multiple punctate lenticular opacities.[Ref]
