Applies to carteolol: oral tablet
Carteolol is generally well-tolerated.  Side effects are usually mild and transient.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects include headache in up to 1% to 17%, asthenia in 8%, insomnia in 5%, dizziness in 8%, paresthesias in 2%, and vertigo, nervousness, headache or fatigue in 1% of patients.[Ref]
Cardiovascular problems include chest pain in 2% and edema in 1% of patients.  Carteolol may cause or worsen AV heart block.  In the rare cases of new or worsened congestive heart failure that are associated with carteolol, a cause-and-effect relationship is not established.[Ref]
The etiology of "chest pain" was not described in studies and reviews from the medical literature.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal complaints of abdominal or epigastric pain in 1% to 7% and diarrhea or nausea in 2% of patients is reported.[Ref]
Respiratory side effects are rare.  Cough, pharyngitis, or sinusitis are reported in 1% to 5% of patients.  Dyspnea is reported rarely.  Patients with a history of reactive airways disease may be more likely to become short of breath while taking carteolol, as during therapy with any beta-blocker.[Ref]
Musculoskeletal pain is reported in approximately 3% to 13% of patients.[Ref]
Carteolol and pindolol, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), have more commonly been associated with muscle cramps and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels than beta-blockers without ISA.[Ref]
Genitourinary complaints of impotence are reported in less than 1% of male patients.[Ref]
Psychiatric side effects including reports of depression have been associated with carteolol.[Ref]
