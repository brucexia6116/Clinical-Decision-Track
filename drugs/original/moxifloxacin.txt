Applies to moxifloxacin: intravenous solution, oral tablet
The most common side effects were nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.  This drug was discontinued due to side effects in 5% of patients overall, 4% of patients using 400 mg orally, 4% using 400 mg IV, and 8% using 400 mg IV/oral sequential therapy.  The most common side effects leading to discontinuation with the oral dose were nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, and vomiting.  The most common side effect leading to discontinuation with the IV dose was rash.  The most common side effects leading to discontinuation with the IV/oral sequential dose were diarrhea and pyrexia.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, gastrointestinal pain, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, decreased amylaseUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Dry mouth, abdominal discomfort, abdominal distention, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastroenteritis, flatulence, increased blood amylase, increased lipase, antibiotic-associated colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis, life-threatening complications)Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Dysphagia, stomatitisFrequency not reported: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, gastrointestinal disorder, pseudomembranous colitis, glossitis, tongue discoloration, upper abdominal pain, oral candidiasis, oral fungal infection[Ref]
Decreased amylase has been reported in at least 2% of patients; however, it has not been determined if this laboratory abnormality was due to the drug or the underlying condition being treated.Antibiotic-associated colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis; associated with life-threatening complications in very rare cases) was reported more often with IV therapy (with or without subsequent oral therapy).The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms has been reported during or after antimicrobial treatment.[Ref]
Seizures (including grand mal convulsions) were reported more often with IV therapy (with or without subsequent oral therapy).Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy (affecting small and/or large axons) resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness have been reported.Disturbed coordination leading to fall with injuries was reported, particularly in elderly patients.Peripheral neuropathy (may be irreversible), polyneuropathy, hearing impairment (including deafness; reversible in most cases), and exacerbation of myasthenia gravis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]

QT prolongation was commonly reported in patients with hypokalemia, otherwise, it was uncommon.Ventricular tachyarrhythmias and hypotension were reported more often with IV therapy (with or without subsequent oral therapy).The mean QTc interval prolongation in a study of 787 patients using oral moxifloxacin was 6 msec versus 1 msec for a comparator group of patients using another antibiotic.  There were 38 outliers in the moxifloxacin group (QTc interval greater than 450 msec for men or 470 msec for women) versus 28 outliers in the comparator group.In another study (n=48), there were greater increases in the QT and QTc interval with 800 mg moxifloxacin than with 1000 mg levofloxacin or 1500 mg ciprofloxacin.Elderly patients experienced more ECG abnormalities than younger patients.Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (including very rare cases of cardiac arrest and torsade de pointes) have also been reported during postmarketing experience, usually in patients with concurrent severe underlying proarrhythmic conditions (e.g., clinically significant bradycardia, acute myocardial ischemia).[Ref]
Increased MCH, neutrophils, WBCs, albumin, and PT ratio, and decreased hemoglobin, RBCs, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and PT ratio have been reported in at least 2% of patients; however, it has not been determined if these laboratory abnormalities were due to the drug or the underlying condition being treated.Agranulocytosis has also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]

Increased and decreased bilirubin levels have been reported in at least 2% of patients; however, it has not been determined if these laboratory abnormalities were due to the drug or the underlying condition being treated.Increased GGT was reported more often with IV therapy (with or without subsequent oral therapy).A 69-year-old male developed jaundice, pruritus, weight loss, dark urine, elevated lever function tests (total bilirubin: 28.45 mg/dL; conjugated bilirubin: 20.6 mg/dL; alkaline phosphatase: 249 units/L; ALT: 58 units/L) 3 weeks after a 5-day course of oral moxifloxacin.
