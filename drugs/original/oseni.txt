As well as its needed effects, alogliptin / pioglitazone may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some alogliptin / pioglitazone side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:

Alogliptin:In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome, more patients (3.9%; n=106) on alogliptin therapy were hospitalized for congestive heart failure (CHF) compare with placebo (3.3%; n=89).  Pioglitazone:In the PROactive trial, a study in 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease who were force-uptitrated to pioglitazone 45 mg once a day or given placebo in addition to standard of care, edema occurred in 27.3% of patients treated with pioglitazone (n=2605) compared with 15.9% of placebo (n=2633) patients.  Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to at least 1 hospitalized congestive heart failure event occurred in 5.7% of patients receiving pioglitazone and 4.1% of patients receiving placebo.  The primary objective of the 3-year PROactive trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in high-risk patients.  No statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo/standard care were observed for time to the first occurrence of their first event (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg).  A total of 514 patients receiving pioglitazone experienced at least 1 event compared with 572 patients receiving placebo/standard care.  Pioglitazone is associated with edema (peripheral, generalized, and pitting edema and fluid retention) when used alone or when used in combination therapy.  In pioglitazone monotherapy trials, edema occurred in 2.5% (n=81), 4.7% (n=275), and 6.5% (n=169) of patients receiving 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of pioglitazone daily for 16 to 26 weeks.  Pioglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea for 16 to 24 weeks resulted in edema in 1.6% (n=184), 11.3% (n=540), and 23.1% (n=351) of patients receiving 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg of pioglitazone daily, respectively.  In a study in patients with NYHA class II or III heart failure the percentage of patients experiencing CHF progression during the study was 13.4% and 8.2% in patients receiving pioglitazone (n=262) and glyburide (n=256), respectively.  Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been received in patients treated with pioglitazone.  Reports have been received from patients both with and without a history of a known history of heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin use.

Alogliptin:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pancreatitis (0.2%)Postmarketing reports: Acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis was reported in 0.2% (n=6) of patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and less than 0.1% (n=2) of patients treated with active comparator or placebo in alogliptin clinical trials.  IN the EXAMINE trial, a cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk, acute pancreatitis was reported in 0.4% (n=10) of patients treated with alogliptin and 0.3% (n=7) of patients receiving placebo.
Pioglitazone:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Elevated ALT (0.3%)Frequency not reported: Decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit
Alogliptin: ALT elevations greater than 3 times upper limit of normal (3 x ULN) occurred in 1.3% of alogliptin treated patients compared with 1.7% of those receiving comparator or placebo during clinical trials.  In the EXAMINE trial, a trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk, ALT increases to 3 x ULN occurred in 2.4% of patients receiving alogliptin (compared with 1.8% of placebo patients).Pioglitazone: Hepatotoxic effects were not observed in pioglitazone clinical trials, however, postmarketing cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure have been reported.
Alogliptin:Postmarketing reports: Hepatic enzyme elevations, fulminant hepatic failurePioglitazone:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (0.3%)Postmarketing reports: Fatal and non-fatal hepatic fail

Alogliptin: Between October 2006 and December 2013, thirty-three cases of severe arthralgia have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Database.  Each case involved the use of 1 or more dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  In all cases, substantial reduction in prior activity level was reported, 10 patients were hospitalized due to disabling joint pain.  In 22 cases, symptoms appeared within 1 month of starting therapy, in 23 cases symptoms resolved less than 1 month after discontinuation.  A positive rechallenge was reported in 8 cases, with 6 cases involving use of a different DPP-4 inhibitor.  Sitagliptin had the greatest number of cases reported (n=28) followed by saxagliptin (n=5), linagliptin (n=2), alogliptin (n=1), and vildagliptin (n=2).
Alogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Headache (4.2%)Pioglitazone:Common (1% to 10%): Headache (9.1%)
Pioglitazone:Postmarketing reports: Macular edema
Pioglitazone:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Bladder cancer (up to 0.44%)
The US FDA has released results of its review of pioglitazone and bladder cancer and concluded that the data suggests use of this drug may be linked to an increase risk of bladder cancer.  A 10-year prospective cohort study in diabetic patients performed by the manufacturer (n=158,918 never users; n=34,181 ever users) identified 1075 newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer in never users and 186 cases in ever users.  The fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) showed pioglitazone use was not associated with an increased risk (HR 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.26).  And while a modest trend towards higher risk with increasing duration was observed, this trend was not statistically significant.  Compared to the interim 5-year results, the 10-year results found weaker associations that were not statistically significant.  However, there are studies that have shown a statistically significant association between exposure to this drug and bladder cancer and an association between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure and bladder cancer.  Overall, this drug may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors, however there is insufficient data to determine whether this drug is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.
Alogliptin-Pioglitazone:Very common (10% or more): Nasopharyngitis (4.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.1%)Alogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Influenza (5.5%), nasopharyngitis (4.7%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.3%)Pioglitazone:Common (1% to 10%): Upper respiratory tract infection (up to 13.2%), sinusitis (6.3%), nasopharyngitis (3.9%)
Postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors use.  These case typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of DPP-4 inhibitor.
