Gatifloxacin (the active ingredient contained in Tequin) has been generally well tolerated with most adverse events reported as mild to moderate.  Gatifloxacin was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 2.7% of over 5,000 treated patients.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea (8%) and diarrhea (4%).  Other gastrointestinal effects reported in 0.1% to 3% of patients include abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, dyspepsia, flatulence, gastritis, glossitis, mouth ulcer, oral moniliasis, stomatitis, and vomiting.

Quinolone class antibiotics have been associated with intestinal perforation.[Ref]
The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antimicrobial treatment.An increased duration therapy may increase the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD).  A long-term care facility reported that 14 of 47 patients developed CDAD after an average 13.5-day duration of gatifloxacin therapy.  In contrast, the mean duration of therapy was 6.9 days in patients who did not develop CDAD.  In this facility, a formulary change from levofloxacin to gatifloxacin was associated with a significantly higher rate of CDAD than with levofloxacin, and the rate decreased after the formulary was changed back to levofloxacin.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects have included dizziness (3%) and headache (3%).  Insomnia, nervousness, paresthesia, somnolence, tremor, vasodilatation, and vertigo have been reported in 0.1% to 3% of patients.

Severe hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia coma, increased serum amylase, and electrolyte abnormalities have also been reported.  Quinolone class antibiotics have been associated with acidosis and elevations in serum triglycerides, serum cholesterol, and serum potassium.[Ref]
Gatifloxacin (the active ingredient contained in Tequin) was associated with 8 cases of torsade de pointes reported to the FDA between 1996 and 2001.  Four cases of torsade de pointes or ventricular fibrillation (including 2 fatalities) have also been reported.[Ref]

In patients with Type II diabetes, increases in serum insulin and decreases in serum glucose have been reported.  Hypoglycemia, in some cases severe, has occurred in patients being treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, usually within 1 to 3 days of initiating gatifloxacin therapy.  Three elderly patients developed severe hypoglycemia that did not respond to intravenous dextrose until the gatifloxacin was stopped.  Hyperglycemia, including nonketotic hyperglycemic coma, has occurred in diabetic patients and previously undiagnosed diabetics, usually within 4 to 10 days of initiating therapy.  Symptomatic and/or severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have also been reported in nondiabetic patients, usually after 3 days of therapy.  Fatal hyperglycemia has been reported in two elderly nondiabetic patients.As of 2002, 10 cases of severe hyperglycemia have been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (age range 53 to 98 years); 6 patients had no history of diabetes.  As of 2003, 19 cases of hypoglycemia and 7 cases of hyperglycemia were reported in Canada.  It has been suggested that hyperglycemia may be related to high drug exposure in patients with age-associated renal dysfunction.Hyperglycemia (blood glucose 607 mg/L) occurred in a nondiabetic 64-year-old woman after 3 days of gatifloxacin 400 mg/day intravenously.  Her serum creatinine upon initiation of therapy was 2.3 mg/dL.[Ref]
