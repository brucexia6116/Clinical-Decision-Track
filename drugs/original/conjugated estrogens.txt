Applies to conjugated estrogens: oral tablet
Other dosage forms:
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by conjugated estrogens. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking conjugated estrogens:
Some of the side effects that can occur with conjugated estrogens may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to conjugated estrogens: injectable powder for injection, oral tablet, vaginal cream
-HRT is associated with a 1.3 to 3-fold increased relative risk of developing VTE, i.e., deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  This event is more likely to occur in the first year of using HRT.-The use of estrogen-only and estrogen-progestin therapy is associated with an up to 1.5 fold increased relative risk of ischemic stroke.-The risk of hemorrhagic stroke is not increased during use of HRT.  This relative risk is not dependent on age or on duration of use, but as the baseline risk is strongly age-dependent, the overall risk of stroke in women who use HRT will increase with age.[Ref]

Breast cancer: -An up to 2-fold increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed is reported in women taking combined estrogen-progestin therapy for more than 5 years.-Any increased risk in users of estrogen-only therapy is substantially lower than that seen in users of estrogen-progestin combinations.  The level of risk is dependent on the duration of use.Endometrial Cancer:-Endometrial cancer risk is about 5 in every 1000 women with a uterus not using HRT.-In women with a uterus, use of estrogen-only HRT is not recommended because it increases the risk of endometrial cancer.-Depending on the duration of estrogen-only use and estrogen dose, the increase in risk of endometrial cancer varied from between 5 and 55 extra cases diagnosed in every 1000 women between the ages of 50 and 65.  -Adding a progestin to estrogen-only therapy for at least 12 days per cycle can prevent this increased risk.  In the Million Women Study the use of five years of combined HRT did not increase risk of endometrial cancer.Ovarian cancer:-Long-term use of estrogen-only and combined estrogen-progestin HRT has been associated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer.  In the Million Women Study 5 years of HRT resulted in 1 extra case per 2500 users.[Ref]
