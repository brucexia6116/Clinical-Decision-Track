Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction: nausea, vomiting, sweating, hives, itching, trouble breathing, swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat, or feeling like you might pass out.
Heparin flush can cause bleeding.  Call your doctor at once if you have easy bruising or unusual bleeding, such as a nosebleed, black or bloody tarry stools, or any bleeding that will not stop.
Stop using heparin flush (the active ingredient contained in Hep-Lock) and call your doctor at once if you have:
signs of a stroke--sudden numbness or weakness (especially on one side of the body), sudden severe headache, slurred speech, problems with vision or balance;
signs of a blood clot in the lung--chest pain, sudden cough, wheezing, rapid breathing, coughing up blood;
signs of a blood clot in your leg--pain, swelling, warmth, or redness in one or both legs;
a light-headed feeling, like you might pass out;
skin changes in your arms, legs, hands, or feet; or
(in an infant) extreme drowsiness, weakness, or gasping for breath.
Less serious side effects are more likely, and you may have none at all.

Hematologic side effects have included new thrombus formation in association with thrombocytopenia resulting from irreversible aggregation of platelets induced by heparin, the so-called "white clot syndrome".  The process may lead to severe thromboembolic complications like skin necrosis, gangrene of the extremities that may lead to amputation, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and possibly death.  Thrombocytopenia has been reported to occur in patients receiving heparin with a reported incidence of 0 to 30%.[Ref]
Hypersensitivity side effects include the remote possibility of hypersensitivity reaction from the entry of extremely small subtherapeutic amounts of the heparin flush (the active ingredient contained in Hep-Lock) solution into the circulation.  Such an occurrence has not been reported.[Ref]
