In clinical trials, 2514 patients were treated with tigecycline.  In comparative trials, serious side effects related to infection were reported more often in patients treated with tigecycline (7%) versus comparators (6%), with sepsis/septic shock reported in 2% and 1% of patients treated with tigecycline and comparator drugs, respectively.  The most common side effects were nausea and vomiting which usually occurred within the first 2 days of treatment.  Tigecycline was discontinued due to side effects in 7% of patients (compared to 6% for all comparators).  Discontinuation was most often due to nausea (1%) and vomiting (1%) in tigecycline-treated patients and nausea (less than 1%) in comparator-treated patients.In all 13 Phase 3 and 4 trials that included a comparator, death occurred in 4% and 3% of patients receiving tigecycline and comparator drugs, respectively.  The cause of this imbalance has not been determined.  In general, deaths resulted from worsening infection, complications of infection, or underlying comorbidities.
