Common (1% to 10%): Facial flushingUncommon (0.1% to 1%): ThrombosisRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Thrombophlebitis; severe cases of hypotensive shock, coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmia, fibrillation and arrestVery rare (less than 0.01%): Disseminated intravascular coagulationFrequency not reported: Generalized vasodilation, flushing, venospasm.  Vascular constriction due to injection rate.  Cardiac decompensation, serious arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia or infarction may occur during coronary arteriography and left ventriculography.
