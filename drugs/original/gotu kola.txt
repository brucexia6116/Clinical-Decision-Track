Gotu kola has been used in alternative medicine as a possibly effective aid in treating venous insufficiency (decreased blood flow return from the feet and legs back to the heart).
Other uses not proven with research have included treating skin wounds, psoriasis, coronary artery disease ("hardened arteries"), circulation problems caused by diabetes, and preventing blood clots in the legs during air travel.
It is not certain whether gotu kola is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. Gotu kola should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.
Gotu kola is often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.
Gotu kola may also be used for purposes not listed in this product guide.
