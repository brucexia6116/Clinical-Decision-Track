If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking quinine, get emergency help immediately:
Disseminated intravascular coagulation has been reported in a 79-year-old female within 12 hours following a second dose of quinine 300 mg.
Hematologic side effects have included thrombocytopenia, purpura, neutropenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, petechiae, and ecchymosis.  At least 7 cases of immune thrombocytopenia have been reported.
Fixed drug eruption (nummular skin lesion) has been reported in a 23-year-old female following exposure to quinine in tonic water.  An open oral challenge, approved by the patient, with 30 mg quinine sulfate triggered the appearance of pruritus, erythema, and edema at the usual sites within 40 minutes of ingestion of the dose.
Dermatologic side effects have included flushing, pruritus, and skin rashes.  Fixed drug eruption (nummular skin lesion) and fatal cutaneous vasculitis have been reported.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal upset.
Renal side effects have included renal failure secondary to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Respiratory side effects have included asthma symptoms, hemoptysis, and a case report of transient bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.
Transient bilateral pulmonary infiltrates have been reported in a 45-year-old woman following a single dose of quinine sulfate 325 mg for nocturnal cramps.  Approximately 45 minutes after she took the single dose of quinine the following symptoms were present: sudden onset of dyspnea, wheezing, cough, breathlessness, severe anxiety, dry nonproductive cough, orthopnea, mild fever, chills, and pleuritic chest discomfort.
Ocular side effects have included visual disturbances including blurred vision with scotomata, photophobia, diplopia, diminished visual fields, disturbed color vision, and blindness.
Cardiovascular side effects have included cardiac dysrhythmias, including prolongation of the QT-interval.
Within 24 hours of taking the first dose of quinine 260 mg for leg cramps, a 57-year-old Native American female presented to the hospital with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, generalized myalgia, headache, fever, chills, and rigor.  The following liver enzymes were dramatically elevated: alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase.  Following discontinuation of quinine, the patient's symptoms resolved within 48 hours and the liver enzyme concentrations declined within 72 hours.
Hepatic side effects have included changes in the hepatic enzyme system that synthesizes vitamin K dependent factors.  At least one case report of hepatotoxicity with elevated alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase has been reported.
Tinnitus and impaired hearing may occur at plasma concentrations over 10 mcg/mL.
Nervous system side effects have included apprehension, restlessness, confusion, syncope, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and nystagmus.  Cinchonism has been reported with repeated doses or high serum levels in 25% to 100% of patients.  Signs and symptoms of cinchonism have been commonly reported.  The clinical presentation of cinchonism have included temporary deafness/slight deafness, tinnitus, headache, dizziness, rash, mental dullness, depression, confusion, and nausea.  Fatalities have been reported from single oral doses of 2 to 8 grams.
Hypersensitivity side effects have been reported in a few patients who experienced severe side effects after a single dose of quinine.
Metabolic side effects have included hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance.
Other side effects have included mucosal bleeding (gingival, gastrointestinal, epistaxis).
