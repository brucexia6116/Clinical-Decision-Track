Common side effects of Elaprase include: abscess, chest wall pain, dyspepsia, infusion related reaction, pruritic rash, pruritus, urticaria, and visual disturbance.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most frequently reported adverse effects in all clinical trials were hypersensitivity reactions and included rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, and headache.The most frequently reported adverse effects following treatment were hypoxia, pyrexia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, musculoskeletal pain, headache, pruritus, and urticaria.
In clinical trials, the most common adverse effects were hypersensitivity reactions and included rash, urticaria, pruritus, flushing, pyrexia, and headache.  Most reactions were resolved with slowing the infusion rate or temporarily stopping the infusion, with or without additional treatments including antihistamines and/or corticosteroids prior to or during infusions.
Very common (10% or more): Hypersensitivity reactionFrequency not reported: Anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactionPostmarketing reports: Late-emergent anaphylactoid reaction
In clinical trials, 32 out of 63 patients 5 years and older tested positive for antidrug antibodies at least 1 time; of the 32 patients, 23 tested positive for antidrug antibodies 3 or more times.  The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was higher in positive antidrug antibody patients than those who tested negative.  Out of 32 antidrug antibody positive patients, 13 also tested positive for neutralizing antibodies.  There was no clear relationship between presence of either type of antibody and therapeutic response.
Very common (10% or more): Antidrug antibody development (50%), neutralizing antibody development (24.3%)
Very common (10% or more): Headache (up to 65.6%)Common (1% to 10%): Dizziness, tremor
Very common (10% or more): Rash (up to 34.4%), pruritus (up to 31.3%), urticaria (up to 16%)Common (1% to 10%): Erythema
Very common (10% or more): Infusion-related reaction (68.8%), pyrexia (up to 62.5%), chest pain (up to 15.6%), infusion site swelling (12.5%)Common (1% to 10%): Face edema, peripheral edema
The most serious infusion-related reactions included anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions.  The most common infusion-related reactions included cutaneous reactions (rash, pruritus, urticaria), pyrexia, headache, hypertension, flushing, wheezing, hypoxia, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia, chest pain, and infusion site swelling.  Treatment/amelioration of infusion-related reactions included slowing the infusion rate, interrupting the infusion, or drug therapy (e.g., antihistamines, antipyretics, low-dose corticosteroids [prednisone, methylprednisolone], beta-agonist nebulization).
Very common (10% or more): Musculoskeletal pain (13%)Common (1% to 10%): Arthralgia
