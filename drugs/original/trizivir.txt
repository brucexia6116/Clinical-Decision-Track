Common side effects of Trizivir include: diarrhea, nausea, and nausea and vomiting.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, abacavir / lamivudine / zidovudine may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking abacavir / lamivudine / zidovudine, check with your doctor immediately:
Some abacavir / lamivudine / zidovudine side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Many of the side effects listed occurred commonly in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, lethargy, rash).
Common (1% to 10%): Hypersensitivity reactionAbacavir, lamivudine, and/or zidovudine:-Postmarketing reports: Sensitization reactions (including anaphylaxis)Abacavir:-Common (1% to 10%): Hypersensitivity reactions (including fever, rash [maculopapular, urticarial], fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pharyngitis, malaise, achiness, dyspnea, cough, lethargy, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, myolysis, edema, abnormal chest X-ray findings [mainly localized infiltrates], paresthesia, anaphylaxis, hepatitis, liver failure, renal failure, hypotension, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, death, lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions [conjunctivitis, mouth ulceration], erythema multiforme, elevated liver function tests, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, lymphopenia)
Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with abacavir.  Such reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and usually occurred within the first 6 weeks of abacavir therapy (median onset: 9 to 11 days); however, abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during therapy.Patients with the human leukocyte antigen subtype B*5701 (HLA-B*5701) allele are at higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; however, such reactions have occurred in patients without the HLA-B*5701 allele.  Abacavir hypersensitivity was reported in about 8% of patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where patients were not screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele; incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions was 1% in clinical trials where HLA-B*5701 carriers were excluded.Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have been characterized by at least 2 of the following key signs/symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, pharyngitis).  Almost all reactions have included fever and/or rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial); however, reactions also reported without fever or rash.  Signs/symptoms reported in at least 10% of patients with hypersensitivity reaction have included rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, fatigue/lethargy, malaise, headache, elevated liver function tests, and myalgia.  Other signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity have included mouth ulceration, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, edema, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis, paresthesia, lymphopenia, hepatitis, liver failure, myolysis, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, renal failure, abnormal chest x-ray findings (mainly infiltrates, which were localized), and death.Symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction worsened with continued therapy and generally resolved when abacavir was discontinued.  Restarting abacavir after a hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in more severe symptoms within hours and included life-threatening hypotension and death.  Rarely, life-threatening reactions have occurred within hours after restarting abacavir in patients who stopped it for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity (or who stopped it with only 1 key symptom of hypersensitivity).

Neutropenia (less than 750/mm3) has been reported in 5% of patients.Agranulocytosis has been reported after the addition of abacavir to a multi-drug regimen.Occasionally, neutropenia and anemia reported with lamivudine were severe.Zidovudine has been associated with hematologic toxicity (including neutropenia and severe anemia), particularly in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease.  Anemia, neutropenia, and leukopenia were reported more often with higher doses (1200 to 1500 mg/day) and in patients with advanced HIV disease (especially with poor bone marrow reserve at baseline) and particularly in those with CD4 cell counts less than 100/mm3.  These hematological effects were generally observed after 4 to 6 weeks of therapy.  Incidence of neutropenia increased in patients with low neutrophil counts, hemoglobin levels, and serum vitamin B12 levels at baseline.Exacerbation of anemia has been reported in HIV-1/HCV-coinfected patients using zidovudine and ribavirin.
Common (1% to 10%): Feeding problems (primarily anorexia/loss of appetite), hypertriglyceridemia, hyperamylasemiaFrequency not reported: HyperglycemiaAbacavir, lamivudine, and/or zidovudine:-Postmarketing reports: Hyperlactatemia (common), lactic acidosis (rare), anorexia/decreased appetite, redistribution/accumulation of body fatAbacavir:-Common (1% to 10%): Anorexia-Frequency not reported: Lactic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, redistribution/accumulation of body fatLamivudine:-Frequency not reported: Lactic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, redistribution/accumulation of body fatZidovudine:-Common (1% to 10%): Anorexia-Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Lactic acidosis (without hypoxemia)-Frequency not reported: Lactic acidosis, hyperlactatemia, redistribution/accumulation of body fatCombination antiretroviral therapy:-Frequency not reported: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat (including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement, peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, "cushingoid appearance"), metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia)
Hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 750 mg/dL), hyperamylasemia (greater than 2 x ULN), and hyperglycemia (greater than 13.9 mmol/L) have been reported in 2%, 2%, and less than 1% of patients, respectively.Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (including fatal cases) have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs.Redistribution/accumulation of body fat has been reported with antiretroviral therapy; causality has not been established.
Elevated CPK (greater than 4 x ULN) has been reported in 7% of patients.Myopathy and myositis (with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV-1 disease) have been associated with prolonged zidovudine use.In 1 zidovudine study, myalgias and elevated CPK occurred in 8% of treated patients with a CD4 cell count less than 200/mm3, and in none of the patients with higher CD4 cell counts.  Dose reduction has not affected the course of myopathy, although drug discontinuation sometimes resulted in improvement of symptoms, generally within a month.  Muscle biopsy has shown atrophic and sometimes necrotic fibers, ragged-red fibers, and large accumulations of mitochondrial and fibrillar sarcoplasmic inclusions.

An observational study investigating the rate of MI in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy showed an increased risk of MI with the use of abacavir within the previous 6 months.  A sponsor-conducted pooled analysis of clinical trials showed no excess risk of MI in abacavir-treated patients as compared with control subjects.  Overall, available data from the observational cohort and from clinical trials were inconclusive.
