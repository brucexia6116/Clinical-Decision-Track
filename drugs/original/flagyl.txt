The most serious side effects reported with metronidazole (the active ingredient contained in Flagyl) have included convulsive seizures, encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, optic and peripheral neuropathy (primarily characterized by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity).  Persistent peripheral neuropathy has been reported with prolonged oral administration of metronidazole.[Ref]
Headache (18%) and dizziness (4%) were reported in patients using the extended-release tablet formulation.  Headaches were considered severe in 10% of these patients.A rare but serious side effect of metronidazole (the active ingredient contained in Flagyl) was peripheral neuropathy which was thought to be related to dose and duration of therapy.  Most cases occurred after doses of 1000 to 2400 mg per day for at least 30 days, or a total dose of 50 grams.  Neuropathy was generally located in the lower extremities and presented with numbness, tingling, and paresthesias.  Patients should be advised to discontinue metronidazole if they experience these effects.  Neuropathy may be persistent despite discontinuation of metronidazole.  Seizures associated with metronidazole were rare, but did occur.Several cases of MRI abnormalities of the dentate nuclei associated with symptoms of ataxia and dysarthria have been reported.  The symptoms and dentate nuclei lesions resolved several weeks after discontinuation of metronidazole.  These symptoms and metronidazole-induced lesions in the brain stem and cerebellar nuclei have also been described in rat studies.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): HeadacheCommon (1% to 10%): DizzinessFrequency not reported: Encephalopathy, aseptic meningitis, peripheral neuropathy (characterized mainly by numbness or paresthesia of an extremity), convulsive seizures, vertigo, syncope, incoordination, ataxia, confusion, dysarthria, weakness, reversible abnormalities in the cerebellar dentate nuclei[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): NauseaCommon (1% to 10%): Taste perversion (metallic taste), abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouthRare (less than 0.1%): Pseudomembranous colitis, pancreatitisFrequency not reported: Sharp unpleasant metallic taste, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, epigastric distress, abdominal cramping, constipation, proctitis, coating of the tongue (furry tongue), glossitis, stomatitis, taste of alcoholic beverages modified[Ref]
Nausea (10%), taste perversion (metallic taste; 9%), abdominal pain (4%), diarrhea (4%), and dry mouth (2%) in patients using the extended-release tablet formulation.  Nausea was considered severe in less than 2% of these patients.Furry tongue, glossitis, and stomatitis may be associated with sudden overgrowth of Candida.Although metronidazole has been used to treat pseudomembranous colitis, it has rarely also been implicated as a causative agent.  These rare cases have been successfully treated with vancomycin.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): VaginitisCommon (1% to 10%): Genital pruritus, abnormal urine, dysmenorrhea, urinary tract infectionRare (less than 0.1%): Darkened urineFrequency not reported: Dysuria, cystitis, polyuria, incontinence, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal itching, dyspareunia, sense of pelvic pressure[Ref]
Vaginitis (15%), genital pruritus (5%), abnormal urine (3%), dysmenorrhea (3%), and urinary tract infection (2%) were reported in patients using the extended-release tablet formulation.Instances of darkened urine have been investigated.  The pigment responsible has not been positively identified; however, it is most likely a metabolite of metronidazole and appears to have no clinical significance.[Ref]
Bacterial infection (7%), influenza-like symptoms (6%), and moniliasis (3%) were reported in patients using the extended-release tablet formulation.A disulfiram-like reaction has been reported in some patients drinking ethanol while taking metronidazole (the active ingredient contained in Flagyl)   Patients have experienced abdominal distress, vomiting, flushing, nausea, headache, and hypotension.  Patients should be advised to refrain from all forms of ethanol while taking metronidazole and for at least 72 hours after the last dose.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Bacterial infection, influenza-like symptoms, moniliasisFrequency not reported: Fever, overgrowth of Candida, disulfiram-like reaction (abdominal distress, nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypotension, or headache) with ethanol[Ref]
Upper respiratory tract infection (4%), rhinitis (4%), sinusitis (3%), and pharyngitis (3%) were reported in patients using the extended-release tablet formulation.
Common (1% to 10%): Upper respiratory tract infection, rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis
Metronidazole (the active ingredient contained in Flagyl) has rarely been associated with a serum sickness-like reaction which presented as arthralgias, malaise, fever, chills, pruritus, and rash.[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Serum sickness-like reactionFrequency not reported: Hypersensitivity (including urticaria, erythematous rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, flushing, nasal congestion, dryness of the mouth [or vagina or vulva], fever), fixed drug eruptions, cross-sensitivity to other nitroimidazole derivatives[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Reversible thrombocytopeniaFrequency not reported: Reversible neutropenia (leukopenia)[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Flattening of the T-wave in ECG tracings
Frequency not reported: Erythematous rash, pruritus
Frequency not reported: Thrombophlebitis (after IV infusion)
Thrombophlebitis can be minimized or avoided by avoiding prolonged use of indwelling IV catheters.
Frequency not reported: Irritability, depression, decreased libido, insomnia, disorientation, agitation, hallucinations
Frequency not reported: Optic neuropathy
Frequency not reported: Anorexia
Frequency not reported: Fleeting joint pains (sometimes resembling "serum sickness")
Breast and colon cancer have been reported in Crohn's disease patients treated with high doses of metronidazole (the active ingredient contained in Flagyl) for extended periods of time.
Frequency not reported: Breast cancer, colon cancer
