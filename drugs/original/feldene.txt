Applies to piroxicam: compounding powder, oral capsule
The most commonly reported adverse effects are abdominal pain/discomfort, flatulence, nausea, epigastric distress, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Anorexia, indigestion, abdominal pain/discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, nausea, gastric and duodenal ulcers, vomiting, epigastric distress Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Dry mouth, esophagitis, gastritis, glossitis, hematemesis, melena, rectal bleeding, stomatitisRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Colic, eructation, pancreatitis	Frequency not reported: Peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal hemorrhage[Ref]
Evidence from observational studies have shown administration of doses greater than 20 mg orally per day increases the risk for gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.  This drug may be associated with a high risk of GI toxicity relative to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  About 1 in 5 patients who develop serious upper GI adverse events due to NSAID therapy are symptomatic.  Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately 1% of patients whom are treated for 3 to 6 months and in 2% to 4% of patients treated for 1 year.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Abnormal renal function Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Renal papillary necrosis, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, renal failure[Ref]
Renal toxicity while using piroxicam has occurred in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion.  In these patients, administration of NSAIDs may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and secondarily, renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Elevated liver enzymesUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hepatitis, jaundiceRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Liver failure[Ref]
Significant elevations of the liver enzymes AST and ALT (about 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have occurred in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Borderline elevations have occurred in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, including this drug.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): EdemaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Congestive heart failure, hypertension, tachycardia, syncopeRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Arrhythmia, exacerbation of angina, hypotension, myocardial infarction, palpitations, vasculitis, chest pain 	Frequency not reported: Arterial thrombotic events[Ref]
Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious and sometimes fatal cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke.[Ref]
Observational studies suggest that piroxicam (the active ingredient contained in Feldene) may be associated with a higher risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions than other non-oxicam NSAIDs.  There is an increased risk early in the course of therapy, with the majority of cases occurring within the first month.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Pruritus, rashUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Alopecia, bruising, desquamation, erythema, photosensitivity, Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Toxic epidermal necrosis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, onycholysis, Stevens - Johnson syndrome, urticaria, vesiculobullous reaction, ecchymosis, petechial rashFrequency not reported: Non-thrombocytopenic purpura (Henoch-Schonlein)[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Anemia, prolonged bleeding timeUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Eosinophilia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopeniaRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia	Frequency not reported: Decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit[Ref]
A combination of dermatological/allergic signs and symptoms suggestive of serum sickness have occasionally occurred while using this drug.  These include arthralgias, pruritus, fever, fatigue and rash (e.g., vesiculobullous reactions and exfoliative dermatitis).[Ref]
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Anaphylaxis, angioedemaFrequency not reported: Serum sickness[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Elevated BUN, elevated serum creatinine, anorexiaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Weight changes, hyperkalemia, fluid retentionRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Appetite changes, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Dizziness, headache, sedationUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Asthenia, drowsiness, malaise, paresthesia, somnolence, tremors, vertigo, amnesiaRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Akathisia, convulsions, coma, meningitisPostmarketing experience: Aseptic meningitis[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Asthma, dyspnea, epistaxis Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Respiratory depression, pneumonia	Frequency not reported: Bronchospasm[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Tinnitus, deafnessUncommon (0.1% to 1%): FeverRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Death, hearing impairment, thirst[Ref]
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Female fertility decreased[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Infections, sepsisRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Positive ANA, flu-like syndrome[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, oliguria, polyuria, proteinuria, urinary frequency, menorrhagia[Ref]
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Sweating[Ref]
