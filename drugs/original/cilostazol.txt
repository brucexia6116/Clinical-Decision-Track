Commonly reported side effects of cilostazol include: infection, change in stool, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, palpitations, and pharyngitis. Other side effects include: abdominal pain, peripheral edema, rhinitis, and tachycardia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Nervous system side effects have commonly included headache (34%) resulting in discontinuation in 3.5% of patients.  Dizziness (10%) and vertigo (2%) have also been reported.  Other less frequently reported side effects have included asthenia, hyperesthesia, and paresthesia.  Postmarketing reports have included intracranial hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebrovascular accident, extradural hematoma and subdural hematoma.
An increase in ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia have been seen in Holter monitored patients.  Cardiovascular damage including endocardial hemorrhage, left ventricular fibrosis, and necrosis of smooth muscle in coronary arteries has been demonstrated in dogs after 52 weeks of cilostazol administration.In the AT-BAT study, one patient died during a bradycardic episode 46 hours after a successful PCI, another patient required surgical revascularization, and one patient experienced no reflow requiring a temporary intra-aortic balloon.
Cardiovascular side effects have included palpitations (10%) and tachycardia (4%).  Peripheral edema has been reported in 7% of patients, and hypertension and angina pectoris have been reported in 2% of patients.  Atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, cerebral infarct, cerebral ischemia, congestive heart failure, heart arrest, hemorrhage, hypotension, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, nodal arrhythmia, postural hypotension, supraventricular tachycardia, syncope, varicose vein, vasodilation, ventricular extrasystoles, and ventricular tachycardia have also been reported.  Post marketing reports have included torsades de pointes and QTc prolongation in patients with cardiac disorders, e.g.  complete atrioventricular block, cardiac failure and bradyarrhythmia.  In these reports cilostazol was used "off label" due to its positive chronotropic action.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included diarrhea (19%), nausea (7%), dyspepsia (6%), abdominal pain (5%), flatulence (3%) and vomiting (2%).  Other gastrointestinal side effects have included anorexia, cholelithiasis, colitis, duodenal ulcer, duodenitis, esophageal hemorrhage, esophagitis, increased GGT, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gum hemorrhage, hematemesis, melena, peptic ulcer, periodontal abscess, rectal hemorrhage, stomach ulcer, and tongue edema.
Musculoskeletal side effects have included back pain (7%), myalgia (3%), leg cramps (2%), and arthritis (2%).
Respiratory side effects have included pharyngitis (10%), rhinitis (7%), increased cough (4%), dyspnea (2%), and bronchitis (2%).  Postmarketing reports have included pulmonary hemorrhage and interstitial pneumonia.
Dermatologic side effects have included rash in 2% of patients.  Postmarketing reports have included pruritus and skin eruptions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
In the AT-BAT study, one patient who did not undergo PCI had major bleeding during CABG on the day following angiography, nine patients had minor bleeding (mostly due to access site bleeding), and two patients developed moderate thrombocytopenia.
Hematologic side effects have included postmarketing reports of thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, leukopenia, and bleeding tendencies.
Hepatic side effects have included postmarketing reports of jaundice, hepatic dysfunction and abnormal liver function tests.
Renal side effects have included postmarketing reports of increased BUN and hematuria.
