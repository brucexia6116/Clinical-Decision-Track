Severe reactions (including myoclonus, seizures, auditory and visual hallucinations, decreased mentation) have been reported with high-dose penicillin therapy or in patients with renal dysfunction.  Severe neurologic reactions were most often seen with penicillin doses of 18 million to 80 million units daily.  These reactions frequently abated after discontinuation of penicillin.  In several cases, penicillin was restarted at a lower dose with no further sequelae.  In 1 review, the authors found that cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) penicillin levels were higher in patients with seizures than in those without.  CSF penicillin levels ranged from 12 to 61 units/mL in the seizure group with the highest CSF concentrations, compared to 7.8 units/mL in the group without seizures.  Neurologic reactions occurred frequently in patients with renal dysfunction.A syndrome characterized by various central nervous system symptoms (e.g., severe agitation with confusion, visual and auditory hallucinations, fear of impending death [Hoigne's syndrome]) has been reported after administration of this drug.  Other symptoms associated with this syndrome have included psychosis, seizures, dizziness, tinnitus, cyanosis, palpitations, tachycardia, and abnormal taste perception.[Ref]

A 28-year-old female developed jaundice, fever, epidermolysis, abnormal liver function tests, and cholestasis several days after receiving a single dose of penicillin IM.  Her liver dysfunction continued for up to 18 months.  She had taken acetaminophen concurrently but denied alcohol use.[Ref]
