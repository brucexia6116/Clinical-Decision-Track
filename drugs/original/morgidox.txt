Benign intracranial hypertension resulting in significant loss of vision has been reported.A 70-year-old female patient with no significant medical history suddenly developed a severe headache followed by vomiting about 15 minutes after the initial dose of doxycycline (the active ingredient contained in Morgidox)   The patient also experienced memory dysfunction; she could not remember the events of the afternoon prior to the doxycycline dose and could not retain the information after she was reminded.  The incident lasted about 30 minutes and she was transported to the hospital for further evaluation.  No further cause, such as intoxication or trauma, could be elicited.  Once at the hospital, the patient was able to remember the events of the afternoon and could retain new information, but amnesia regarding the events of the 30 minutes following the onset of the headache persisted.  The patient's laboratory results, CT scan, MRI scan, cerebrospinal fluid, and EEG showed no pathology.  When the patient was discharged 2 days later, the amnesia for the 30 minutes continued.  After elimination of other symptomatic causes, the amnesia was concluded to be due to the doxycycline because of the close relation of the doxycycline dose and the onset of symptoms.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Headache (up to 26%)Frequency not reported: Sinus headache, dizziness, drowsiness, amnesia, paresthesias of body areas exposed to sunlight, phrenic nerve paralysis after sclerotherapyPostmarketing reports: Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension), headacheTetracyclines:Frequency not reported: Bulging fontanels in infants, benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) in adults[Ref]

Numerous cases of esophageal ulceration have been reported.  In most of the cases the patients had taken their medication at bedtime, usually without enough liquid.  Patients often present with severe retrosternal pain and difficulty swallowing.  Ulcerations generally resolve within a week after discontinuation of the medication.  One case report describes severe hiccups of 4-day duration associated with esophagitis following the first dose of doxycycline.Esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet formulations of tetracycline-class drugs.  Most took medication immediately before going to bed.[Ref]

The long-term use of tetracyclines has been associated with microscopic brown-black discoloration of the thyroid gland; abnormal thyroid function has not been reported.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Joint pain (6%), muscle pain (1%)
Common (1% to 10%): Nasopharyngitis (5%), sore throat (5%), sinus congestion (5%), coughing (4%), sinus headache (up to 4%), sinusitis (3%), bronchitis (3%), nasal congestion (2%), pharyngolaryngeal pain (1%)

In a double-blinded study, doxycycline was found to be more phototoxic than minocycline and demeclocycline.  Paresthesias of the body areas exposed to sunlight may be early signs of sunburn reactions.A case report of a possible photoallergic reaction describes scaly erythema and vesicles on the face and neck associated with doxycycline administration.  Upon rechallenge, a flare with erythema, itching and burning occurred in the same area.Another case report was documented in Australian troops treated with doxycycline 100 mg daily for malaria prophylaxis while on deployment in East Timor, a group of islands within the Malaysian archipelago located close to the equator.  Of the 135 troops, 22 exhibited phototoxic reactions to low dosages of doxycycline that resembled severe sunburn with erythematous plaques on the sun-exposed areas.  The troops used a sunscreen containing oxybenzone.An 11-year-old boy treated with doxycycline for brucellosis was evaluated for painless brown nail discoloration.  Doxycycline was initiated for brucellosis but stopped when the boy developed photosensitivity, but 15 days after the initiation of therapy brown nail discoloration developed.  Other than the brown discoloration, the boy's physical condition was normal and the discoloration disappeared within one month.[Ref]
