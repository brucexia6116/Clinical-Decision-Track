Commonly reported side effects of aztreonam include: fever.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Aztreonam for injection was generally well tolerated.  The overall incidence of systemic side effects was about 1% to 1.3%.
Aztreonam for inhalation:Very common (10% or more): Cough (54%), nasal congestion (16%), wheezing (16%)Common (1% to 10%): Bronchospasm (3%)Postmarketing reports: DyspneaAztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Wheezing, dyspnea, chest pain, sneezing, nasal congestion
Aztreonam for inhalation:Very common (10% or more): Pyrexia (13%), pharyngolaryngeal pain (12%)Common (1% to 10%): Chest discomfort (8%), abdominal pain (7%)Aztreonam for injection:Common (1% to 10%): Superinfection (up to 10%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Weakness, fever, malaise, flushing
Superinfection has been reported in up to 10% of patients during aztreonam therapy and was usually due to enterococcus or staphylococcus.
Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment.
Aztreonam for inhalation:Common (1% to 10%): Vomiting (6%)Aztreonam for injection:Common (1% to 10%): 1% to 1.3%: Nausea, vomiting, diarrheaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Abdominal cramps, mouth ulcer, altered taste, numb tongue, halitosisRare (less than 0.1%): Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, gastrointestinal bleeding
Toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with aztreonam has been reported in very ill patients on many other medications, making implication of aztreonam difficult.
Aztreonam for inhalation:Common (1% to 10%): Rash (2%)Aztreonam for injection:Common (1% to 10%): Rash (1% to 1.3%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, purpura, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, petechiae, pruritus, diaphoresis
Aztreonam for injection:Common (1% to 10%): Discomfort/swelling at the injection site after intramuscular administration (2.4%), phlebitis/thrombophlebitis after intravenous administration (1.9%)
A 57-year-old male developed a widespread maculopapular eruption two hours after receiving aztreonam.  Corticosteroids and antihistamines were needed to control the reaction which disappeared after 8 days.  The patient also showed cross-reactivity to ceftazidime which shares the same side chain as aztreonam.
Aztreonam for inhalation:Frequency not reported: Allergic reaction (with facial rash, facial swelling, throat tightness)Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasmRare (less than 0.1%): Maculopapular eruption (at least 1 case)
A case of myelosuppression associated with aztreonam has been reported, but because many other drugs were administered and because the patient was bacteremic, implication of aztreonam as the causative agent was difficult.In vitro studies have shown that aztreonam may inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation at high concentrations.  Clinically, therapeutic doses of aztreonam have not been associated with bleeding problems.
Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Pancytopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosisFrequency not reported: Increased prothrombin time, increased partial thromboplastin time, positive Coombs' test
Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Hepatitis, jaundice, signs or symptoms of hepatobiliary dysfunctionFrequency not reported: Elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated alkaline phosphatase
Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hypotension (less than 1%), transient electrocardiogram changes (ventricular bigeminy, premature ventricular contractions; less than 1%)
Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Seizure, headache, confusion, vertigo, paresthesia, insomnia, dizziness, tinnitus
Aztreonam for inhalation:Postmarketing reports: Arthralgia, joint swellingAztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Muscular aches (less than 1%)
Aztreonam for injection:Rare (less than 0.1%): Acute interstitial nephritis (at least 1 case)Frequency not reported: Increased serum creatinine
Acute interstitial nephritis associated with aztreonam has been reported in a very ill patient receiving many other medications.
Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Vaginal candidiasis, vaginitis, breast tenderness
Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Diplopia (less than 1%)
