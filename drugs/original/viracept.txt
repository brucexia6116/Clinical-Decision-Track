Most side effects were of mild severity.  The most common side effect was diarrhea, which was usually of mild to moderate severity.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Diarrhea (up to 20%)Common (1% to 10%): Nausea, flatulenceFrequency not reported: Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, epigastric pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, increased amylase, mouth ulceration, pancreatitis, vomiting[Ref]

Increased bleeding (including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis) in patients with hemophilia type A and B has been associated with protease inhibitors.  In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted and some patients required additional factor VIII.  A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.[Ref]

Frequency not reported: Anxiety, depression, emotional lability, insomnia, sleep disorder, suicidal ideation[Ref]
