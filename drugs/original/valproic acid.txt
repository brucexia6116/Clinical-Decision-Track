As well as its needed effects, valproic acid may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking valproic acid, check with your doctor immediately:

If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking valproic acid, get emergency help immediately:

Some valproic acid side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:


Applies to valproic acid: injectable solution, intravenous solution, oral capsule, oral delayed release capsule, oral syrup
The most commonly reported side effects at the start of therapy include nausea, vomiting, and indigestion; these effects are usually transient.  Sedative effects occur most often in patients receiving combination therapy.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gingival disorder, nausea, vomitingCommon (1% to 10%): Constipation, dry mouth, eructation, fecal incontinence, flatulence, gastralgia, gastroenteritis, glossitis, periodontal abscess, hematemesis, stomatitisUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pancreatitis (life-threatening)[Ref]
Severe nausea, emesis, and anorexia may be due to valproate-induced hyperammonemia or hepatitis.  Adverse gastrointestinal effects may be attenuated by administering doses with food, or through the use of delayed-release valproic acid.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Increased liver enzymes (particularly early in treatment), liver injury, SGOT increased, SGPT increased Frequency not reported: Severe liver damage (including hepatic failure sometimes resulting in death), increased serum bilirubin, abnormal changes in other liver function tests[Ref]
Prompt withdrawal of valproic acid is recommended if significant hepatic dysfunction occurs.  Mild elevations in transaminases and amylase may be managed by dose reductions.Risk factors for valproic acid-associated hepatitis are young age (particularly age less than 2 years old), poor nutritional status, mental retardation, underlying metabolic disease, and concomitant use of other anticonvulsant medications.  Characteristic pathological features include microvesicular steatosis.[Ref]
Loss of seizure control may indicate associated hepatitis.  Rarely, encephalopathy with or without fever has developed shortly after the introduction of valproate monotherapy without evidence of hepatic dysfunction or inappropriately high plasma valproate levels.  There have been fatalities in patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy, particularly in patients with underlying urea cycle disorders.Rare cases of lethargy occasionally progressing to stupor, sometimes with associated hallucinations or convulsions have been reported.  Encephalopathy and coma have very rarely been observed.  These cases have often been associated with too high a starting dose or too rapid a dose escalation or concomitant use of other anticonvulsants, e.g., phenobarbital or topiramate.  They have usually been reversible on withdrawal of treatment or reduction of dosage.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Dizziness, headache, somnolence, tremorCommon (1% to 10%): Abnormal gait, amnesia, catatonic reaction, convulsion, disturbance in attention, dysarthria, extrapyramidal disorder, hypertonia, hypokinesia, incoordination, increased reflexes, memory impairment, nystagmus, paresthesia, speech disorder, stupor, tardive dyskinesia, taste perversionUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Ataxia, coma, encephalopathy, lethargy, reversible parkinsonismRare (less than 0.1%): Cognitive disorder, reversible dementia associated with reversible cerebral atrophyFrequency not reported: Cerebral atrophy, dementia[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Edema, hypertension, hypotension, palpitations, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, tachycardia, vasodilationFrequency not reported: Bradycardia, cutaneous vasculitis, hematoma formation[Ref]
Valproic acid has been associated with stomatitis and cutaneous leukoclastic vasculitis.  A case of psoriasiform eruption has been reported in a patient receiving valproic acid.The mechanism of valproic acid induced alopecia is believed to be telogen shedding.  This is believed to appear within three months of the initiation of valproic acid therapy.  Alopecia does not appear to be dose related.  Limited data have reported that supplements with a zinc and selenium-containing vitamin may be useful in the prevention of valproic acid associated alopecia.  Hair regrowth normally begins within 6 months, although the hair may become curlier than previously.Serious skin reactions have been reported with concomitant administration of lamotrigine and valproate.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): AlopeciaCommon (1% to 10%): Discoid lupus erythematosus, dry skin, ecchymosis, furunculosis, maculopapular rash, petechia, pruritus, rash, seborrheaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Abnormal hair texture, abnormal hair growth, hair color changes, sweatingRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysisVery rare (less than 0.01%): Acne, hirsutismFrequency not reported: Angioedema, generalized pruritus, photosensitivity[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hyperandrogenism, syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretionRare (less than 0.1%): HypothyroidismFrequency not reported: Abnormal thyroid function tests, elevated serum testosterone concentrations, parotid gland swelling[Ref]
One study has suggested that 80% of women treated with valproic acid before the age of 20 have polycystic ovaries or hyperandrogenism.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Amenorrhea, cystitis, dysmenorrhea, dysuria, enuresis, metrorrhagia, urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, vaginal hemorrhage, vaginitisVery rare (less than 0.01%): GynecomastiaFrequency not reported: Breast enlargement, galactorrhea, polycystic ovary disease[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): ThrombocytopeniaCommon (1% to 10%): Anemia, hemorrhageUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Leucopenia, pancytopeniaRare (less than 0.1%): Abnormal coagulation tests (e.g., prolonged prothrombin time, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, prolonged thrombin time, prolonged INR), agranulocytosis, bone marrow failure, decreased coagulation factors, including pure red cell aplasia, macrocytosisFrequency not reported: Aplastic anemia, bone marrow suppression, bruising, eosinophilia, frank hemorrhage, hypofibrinogenemia, anemia including macrocytic with or without folate deficiency, relative lymphocytosis[Ref]
Some clinicians recommend monitoring complete blood counts (including platelet counts) at baseline, then monthly for three months, and every three months thereafter.Data from a study of 265 patients strongly suggests a causal relationship between rising plasma valproic acid levels and reduced platelet counts, with additional risk factors including female gender and lower baseline platelet counts.Isolated findings of a reduction in blood fibrinogen and/or an increase in prothrombin time have been reported, particularly with high doses.  Spontaneous bruising or bleeding is an indication for withdrawal of medication pending investigations.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Allergic reaction, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Injection site pain, injection site reactionUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Injection site inflammation[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): AnorexiaCommon (1% to 10%): Weight loss/gain, increased appetite, hyponatremiaRare (less than 0.1%): HyperammonemiaFrequency not reported: Acute intermittent porphyria, minor elevations of LDH (dose related), decreased carnitine concentrations, hyperglycinemia[Ref]
Cases of isolated and moderate hyperammonemia without change in liver function tests may occur, are usually transient and should not cause treatment discontinuation.  However, they may present clinically as vomiting, ataxia, and increasing clouding of consciousness.  Valproate should be discontinued if these symptoms occur.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Arthralgia, arthrosis, leg cramps, myalgia, myasthenia, twitchingUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures on long term therapyRare (less than 0.1%): Rhabdomyolysis, systemic lupus erythematosus Frequency not reported: Bone pain[Ref]

Rare (less than 0.1%): Myelodysplastic syndrome[Ref]
