If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking lixisenatide, get emergency help immediately:
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, dizziness, and hypoglycemia.
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (up to 26.5%), vomiting (up to 10.5%)Common (1% to 10%): Dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, upper abdominal painFrequency not reported: Pancreatitis
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions including nausea and vomiting were responsible for discontinuation of treatment in 4.3% of patients.  During clinical trials, the severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions were graded as mild, moderate or severe in 64.2%, 32.3%, and 3.5% of cases, respectively.  The majority of reactions occurred during the first 3 weeks of treatment.  During clinical trials, 21 cases of pancreatitis were reported including acute pancreatitis (n=3), pancreatitis (n=12), chronic pancreatitis (n=5), and edematous pancreatitis (n=1).  Of these cases, some had risk factors such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse.  Fourteen cases of pancreatitis were reported in the comparator-treated.
Very common (10% or more): Development of anti-lixisenatide antibodies (69.8%)
Pooled analysis of drug-treated patients has found that almost 70% were antibody positive at 24 weeks.  Of the antibody positive patients, those with the highest antibody concentrations (greater than 100 nmol/L) had attenuated glycemic responses.  Additionally, a higher incidence of allergic reactions and injection site reactions occurred in antibody positive patients.
