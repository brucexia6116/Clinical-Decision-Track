The more commonly observed adverse reactions have included those of pressure sensation, flushing, tingling, dizziness/vertigo, warm/hot sensation, burning sensation, flushing, and numbness; formulation specific events including injection site reactions, application site pain, and nasal discomfort have been reported.
Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, and rare reports of acute myocardial infarction, have been reported within a few hours after administration of 5-HT1 agonists.Chest discomfort is usually noncardiac in origin.  A survey of 453 migraine patients found chest symptoms occurred in up to 58% of patients in at least some attacks and in up to 42% of patients in all attacks.One study of 735 consecutive migraine patients reported that chest symptoms are frequent, but rarely important adverse effects of (primarily subcutaneous) sumatriptan (the active ingredient contained in Alsuma)   The risk of chest symptoms was reported to be patient dependent and not related, even opposite, to cardiovascular disease.  This report contradicts the hypothesis that chest symptoms after sumatriptan are caused by cardiac ischemia.Another study of 125 patients concluded that panic-like symptoms may explain the chest pain and related side effects after sumatriptan administration in patients with high levels of anxiety.
Common (1% to 10%): Chest pain/tightness/pressure and/or heaviness, flushing, neck/throat/jaw pain/tightness/pressure, transient increases in blood pressure (arising soon after treatment)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Bradycardia, hypertension, hypotension, palpitations, pulsating sensations, tachycardia, various transient ECG changes (nonspecific ST or T-wave changes, prolongation of PR or QTc intervals, sinus arrhythmia, nonsustained ventricular premature beats, isolated junctional ectopic beats, atrial ectopic beats, delayed activation of the right ventricle)Rare (less than 0.1%): Abnormal pulse, arrhythmia, pallor, Raynaud's phenomenon, vasodilationFrequency not reported: Abdominal aortic aneurysm, angina, atherosclerosis, cerebrovascular lesion, coronary artery vasospasm, edema, heart block, peripheral cyanosis, phlebitis, thrombosis, transient myocardial ischemiaPostmarketing reports: Cyanosis, hypotension, myocardial infarction, palpitations

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred with 5-HT1 treatment; some have resulted in fatalities.  One case of sumatriptan-induced cortical stroke has been reported in a patient with sagittal sinus thrombosis.  In some cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, and the 5-HT1 agonist administered in the belief that presenting symptoms were due to migraine when they were not.  Patients with migraine may also be at an increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events such as stroke, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attacks.Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks.Serotonin syndrome is characterized by mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).  The onset of symptoms generally occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotoninergic medications.Seizures have been reported in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures and also in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent.
Common (1% to 10%): Abdominal discomfort, dysphagia, nausea and/or vomitingUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Diarrhea, gastroesophageal refluxRare (less than 0.1%): Flatulence/eructation, gallstones, peptic ulcer, retchingFrequency not reported: Abdominal distention, colitis, constipation, dental pain, disorder of mouth and tongue (e.g., burning of tongue, numbness of tongue, dry mouth), dyspeptic symptoms, feelings of gastrointestinal pressure, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, gastrointestinal pain, hematemesis, hypersalivation, hyposalivation, intestinal obstruction, ischemic colitis, melena, oral itching and irritation, pancreatitis, salivary gland swelling, swallowing disorders
It is unclear whether the nausea and vomiting is related to sumatriptan therapy or to the underlying condition.One report has suggested that "throat tightness" and chest pain associated with sumatriptan may sometimes be attributable to changes in esophageal motility.
