Applies to telbivudine: oral solution, oral tablet
In general, telbivudine was usually well tolerated in clinical studies, with most side effects described as mild or moderate and not ascribed to telbivudine.  Discontinuations due to adverse events were reported in 4% of telbivudine recipients and 4% of lamivudine recipients.  The most common side effects leading to discontinuation of telbivudine included elevated creatine kinase (CK), nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, myalgia, and myopathy.[Ref]
Increased CK occurred more frequently during telbivudine treatment during clinical trials.  By 104 weeks of treatment, 79% of telbivudine-treated patients and 47% of lamivudine-treated patients reported Grade 1 to 4 CK elevations.  Thirteen percent and 4% of telbivudine- and lamivudine-treated patients reported Grade 3 or 4 CK elevations, respectively.  Most patients with CK elevations did not exhibit symptoms, but the average recovery time was longer in telbivudine-treated patients versus lamivudine-treated patients.  Of the telbivudine-treated patients with Grade 1 to 4 CK elevations, 10% experienced a musculoskeletal side effect compared to 5% of lamivudine-treated patients.  By 208 weeks of treatment, 16% of telbivudine-treated patients reported Grade 3 or 4 CK elevations, most of which were asymptomatic (74%), transient (98% lasted 1 or 2 visits), and resolved spontaneously or returned to baseline levels (93%).Cases of myopathy/myositis have been reported with telbivudine use several weeks to months following treatment initiation.[Ref]

Very common (10% or more): Fatigue (13%)Common (1% to 10%): Pyrexia (4%)Frequency not reported: Malaise, vertigo, influenza and influenza-like symptoms, postprocedural pain[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Headache (10%)Common (1% to 10%): Dizziness (4%), insomnia (3%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Peripheral neuropathy (less than 1%)Frequency not reported: Migraine, sinus headache, tension headachePostmarketing reports: Paresthesia, hypoesthesia[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): ALT greater than 3 times baseline (7%), AST (SGOT) greater than 3 times baseline (6%), ALT greater than 10 times ULN and 2 times baseline (i.e., acute hepatitis flare; 5%), increased ALT (3%), hepatitis B exacerbation (2%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Total bilirubin greater than 5 times ULN (less than 1%)Frequency not reported: Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, hypercholesterolemia, posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis[Ref]
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of telbivudine and other nucleoside analogs alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents.The incidence of ALT flares (ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times baseline) was similar (3%) in the two treatment arms in the first 6 months.  After week 24, ALT flares were reduced to 2% in telbivudine-treated patients versus 5% in lamivudine-treated patients.Posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis have occurred after discontinuation of telbivudine.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea (6%), upper abdominal pain (6%), nausea (5%), abdominal pain (3%), abdominal distension (3%), dyspepsia (3%), lipase greater than 2.5 times ULN (2%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Amylase greater than 3 times ULN (less than 1%)Frequency not reported: Gastritis, sore throat, dry mouth, decreased appetite, abdominal discomfort, lower abdominal pain, gastrointestinal pain[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Cough (6%), pharyngolaryngeal pain (5%)Frequency not reported: Upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Rash (4%), pruritus (2%)Frequency not reported: Acne[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than or equal to 749/mm3; 2%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Thrombocytopenia (platelets less than or equal to 49,999/mm3; less than 1%)[Ref]
Postmarketing reports: Lactic acidosis
At least one patient reporting polyuria was receiving a diuretic for ascites.[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Polyuria[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Hematuria, irregular menstruation[Ref]
