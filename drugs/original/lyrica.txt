Symptoms of angioedema have included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), and neck (throat and larynx).  There have also been reports of life-threatening angioedema with respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment.  Therapy should be discontinued immediately in patients with these symptoms.  Caution is recommended if this drug is used in patients who have had a previous episode of angioedema.  Patients who are taking other drugs associated with angioedema (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE inhibitors]) may be at increased risk of developing angioedema.
