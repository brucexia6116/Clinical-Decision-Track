Some of the side effects that can occur with cefazolin may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:

Common (1% to 10%): Pain at IM injection site (sometimes with induration)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Thrombophlebitis with IV administrationFrequency not reported: Phlebitis at injection site, induration[Ref]

Risk factors for coagulation disorders have included insufficient vitamin K or other blood clotting factors, artificial nutrition, poor diet, liver or renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and disorders/diseases that cause bleeding (e.g., hemophilia, stomach ulcers, duodenal ulcers).A 26-year-old hemodialysis patient with a coagulase-positive staphylococcal arteriovenous fistula graft infection was found to have a hematoma and increased thrombin, prothrombin, and partial thromboplastin times after receiving 1 g IV followed by 0.5 g every 8 hours for 12 days.  The laboratory changes resolved after therapy was stopped, but recurred when this drug was reinstituted.[Ref]

Transient increases in AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin, LDH, and alkaline phosphatase have been reported.[Ref]
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Increased AST, increased ALT, increased GGT, increased bilirubin, hepatitis (transient), cholestatic jaundice (transient)Cephalosporin-class:Frequency not reported: Hepatic dysfunction (including cholestasis), elevated bilirubin[Ref]
Transient increases in BUN were generally reported in patients using other potentially nephrotoxic agents concomitantly.[Ref]
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Nephrotoxicity, interstitial nephritis, undefined nephropathy, increased BUN (transient)Frequency not reported: Increased creatinine levels, renal failure, increased serum ureaCephalosporin-class:-Frequency not reported: Renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, increased creatinine, interstitial nephritis (reversible fever, azotemia, pyuria, eosinophiluria; with some cephalosporins)[Ref]
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Vaginitis, genital candidiasis (moniliasis), proteinuriaVery rare (less than 0.01%): Genital pruritusFrequency not reported: Vulvar pruritus[Ref]
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Nightmares, nervousness/anxiety, insomnia, confusion
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Disturbed color vision
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Anaphylactic shock (including swelling of larynx with narrowing of airways, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, falling blood pressure, swollen tongue)Frequency not reported: Anaphylaxis, allergic reaction (including eosinophilia, urticaria, itching, drug fever, skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), allergic cross-sensitivityCephalosporin-class:-Frequency not reported: Allergic reactions, serum sickness-like reaction[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Hypotension[Ref]
