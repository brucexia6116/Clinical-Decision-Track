Common side effects of Lipodox 50 include: severe anemia, severe erythrodysesthesia syndrome, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, erythrodysesthesia syndrome, alopecia, anemia, asthenia, bone marrow depression, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anorexia. Other side effects include: asthma, syncope, severe neutropenia, back pain, chest pain, dyspnea, facial edema, fever, headache, hypotension, pruritus, skin rash, tachycardia, pharyngitis, and chills.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Myelosuppression, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome), stomatitis, cardiac toxicity, and infusion-related reactions are the major dose-limiting toxicities of doxorubicin liposomal (the active ingredient contained in Lipodox 50) The side effects listed in this section were for the most part compiled from 4 clinical trials with ovarian cancer patients (n=373) and from 4 trials with AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma patients (n=705).  Causality was difficult for AIDS patients due to underlying disease and concurrent drug therapy.
Cardiovascular effects have been reported in 9.6% of Kaposi's sarcoma patients; 4.3% were possibly or probably related to doxorubicin liposomal (the active ingredient contained in Lipodox 50)   Nine cases of cardiomyopathy and/or congestive heart failure were reported.  Seven (1%) severe events included arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, pericardial effusion, and tachycardia.  Other cardiac side effects have included chest pain, and hypotension 1 to 5% of patients.  Other reported effects have included hypertension, angina pectoris, postural hypotension, palpitations, syncope, shock, bradycardia, phlebitis, cardiomegaly, thrombophlebitis, hemorrhage, palpitation, syncope, bundle branch block, cardiac arrest, thrombosis, and ventricular arrhythmia in less than 1%.Cardiovascular side effects of conventional doxorubicin have included congestive heart failure due to the development of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in 1% to 2% of patients.  Retrospective data have shown that the incidence of clinical heart failure in patients with preexisting LV systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction [LVEF] Early effects of anthracyclines also include extremely rare cases of pericarditis-myocarditis (which can affect patients with no prior history of cardiac disease and which carries a high mortality rate of about 20%), left ventricular dysfunction (which may lead to clinically significant heart failure in patients with limited cardiac reserve), and arrhythmias, the most common of which is sinus tachycardia.  Although rhythm disturbances are common after acute administration they are rarely of clinical importance.  Isolated cases of symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia, heart block, and ventricular arrhythmias (some sudden and fatal) have also been reported.
The risk of heart failure is significantly increased after total doses of 550 mg/m2 (350 to 400 mg/m2 if there is history of prior radiation therapy which included the heart or the area around it or use of other potentially cardiotoxic agents, such as cyclophosphamide).  Doxorubicin-induced heart failure can present one month to one year or more after termination of therapy.  It is increasingly common to note LATE cardiomyopathy, especially in patients who received doxorubicin as a child or adolescent.  Prevention has focused on cumulative dose limitation, earlier diagnosis (radionuclide angiocardiography or echocardiography), alterations in the schedule of administration (substitution of prolonged, continuous IV infusion for bolus injection), the development of less cardiotoxic anthracyclines, and use of cardioprotectors (dexrazoxane).Treatment of doxorubicin-induced heart failure consists of traditional therapy with rest, digitalis, diuretics, and/or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as indicated.While there has not been a reliable marker to predict which patients will develop doxorubicin-induced heart failure, serial noninvasive testing of LV function (radionuclide angiocardiography is usually more accurate than echocardiography) is strongly recommended (ECG has limited value).  Recent data suggest plasma endothelin-1 and/or atrial natriuretic peptide levels may be useful for predicting the risk of cardiotoxicity associated with this drug.  Endomyocardial biopsy permits a definitive evaluation of risk, but is invasive, expensive, and potentially risky.Limited animal data suggest vitamins A and E, adenosine, coenzyme Q, N-acetylcysteine, and methylene blue may reduce the incidence of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.The benefits of doxorubicin must be carefully weighed against the risks in patients with a demonstrable decrease in cardiac function.
Hematologic side effects include dose-dependent myelosuppression which may be profound.  Anemia is most common, followed by neutropenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.  Hematologic events compiled from ovarian cancer trials have included leukopenia (42.2% Side effects compiled from Kaposi's sarcoma trials have included anemia (19.4%), hypochromic anemia (9.8%), thrombocytopenia (9.2%), hemolysis (1% to 5%), increased prothrombin time (1% to 5%), eosinophilia (
The leukocyte count usually reaches a nadir at 10 to 14 days after treatment.Severe and/or persistent myelosuppression may result in superinfection and/or hemorrhage.  GCSF has been used clinically to avoid dose reductions or interruptions in dose schedules.A single case of acute hemolytic anemia has been reported after the administration of doxorubicin to a patient with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.  This drug generates reactive oxygen compounds and methemoglobin in normal human red blood cells (RBCs) in vitro.  In RBCs deficient in G6PD doxorubicin probably poses a potent oxidant stress.  Thus patients with G6PD might be susceptible to hemolysis after receiving doxorubicin.Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia has occurred in patients treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors, including anthracyclines.
A scalp tourniquet and/or scalp cooling may prevent doxorubicin-induced alopecia.  Doxorubicin is often avoided in diseases where the scalp would become a reservoir for disease (i.e., lymphoma or leukemia).
Dermatologic side effects compiled from clinical trials have included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome) (37% all grades, 16.4% Grade 3/4 in ovarian cancer patients), rash (15.2%), alopecia (8.9% to 12.7%), and dry skin (5.5%).  Pruritus, skin discoloration, skin disorders, herpes simplex, vesiculobullous rash, maculopapular rash, exfoliative dermatitis, herpes zoster, and sweating were reported in 1% to 5%.  Skin ulcers, skin ulcer, skin discoloration, cutaneous moniliasis, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, furunculosis, psoriasis, pustular rash, skin necrosis, urticaria,  herpes simplex, contact dermatitis, fungal dermatitis, skin nodules, urticaria, and acne were reported in less than 1%.
Gastrointestinal side effects compiled from ovarian cancer trials have included stomatitis (37.4% all grades, 7.7% Grade 3/4), nausea (37.7% all grades, 4.2% Grade 3/4), vomiting (21.6%), constipation (12.7%), anorexia (11.9%), diarrhea (10%), and abdominal pain (8%).  Dyspepsia, oral moniliasis, mouth ulceration, esophagitis, and dysphagia were reported in 1% to 5% of patients.  Gingivitis, eructation, increased salivation, melena, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, proctitis, jaundice, ileus, periodontal abscess, flatulence, aphthous stomatitis, gastritis, glossitis, and gum hemorrhage were reported in less than 1%.Side effects were compiled from Kaposi's sarcoma trials have included nausea (16.9%), vomiting (7.8%), diarrhea (6.8%), stomatitis (6.8%), and oral moniliasis (5.5%).  Mouth ulceration, glossitis, constipation, aphthous stomatitis, anorexia, dysphagia, and abdominal pain were reported in 1% to 5%.  Dyspepsia, gastritis, gingivitis, ulcerative proctitis, colitis, esophageal ulcer, esophagitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, oral leukoplakia, pancreatitis, ulcerative stomatitis, increased appetite, sclerosing cholangitis, tenesmus, and fecal impaction were reported in less than 1%.
Nausea and vomiting are preventable with appropriate antiemetic therapy.Stomatitis or other ulcerations typically occur 2 to 10 days after administration and, if severe, can be complicated by bleeding or local infection.  Severe cases of colonic ulceration can be fatal.
Hypersensitivity side effects have included acute infusion-associated reactions (flushing, shortness of breath, facial swelling, headache, chills, back pain, tightness in the chest or throat, and/or hypotension) in 5% to 10% of patients treated with doxorubicin liposomal (the active ingredient contained in Lipodox 50)   Other side effects have included unspecified allergic reactions (1% to 5%) and anaphylactoid reaction (
Renal side effects have included rare cases of new or worsened renal insufficiency.  A single case of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis without evidence of a secondary cause or immunologic mechanism has been reported.  Albuminuria has been reported in 1% to 5% of Kaposi's sarcoma patients.  Creatinine elevations, abnormal kidney function, hydronephrosis, hematuria, glycosuria, increased BUN, and kidney failure have been reported in less than 1%.
Renal insufficiency has been associated with doxorubicin-induced hyperuricemia (secondary to cell lysis).  Adequate hydration, diuresis, and allopurinol can be preventative.Animal data suggest that doxorubicin may cause glomerular basement membrane injury via production of reactive oxygen species.  Administration of some antioxidants, however, have failed to reduce the urinary excretion of lysozyme and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (markers of tubule injury) in treated animals.
Other side effects of doxorubicin have included the predisposition of patients who have previously received radiation therapy (XRT) to demonstrate the so called "recall" phenomenon.
Radiation pneumonitis or esophagitis may be more likely with the combination of doxorubicin and XRT than with XRT alone.  Prior XRT to the heart/mediastinum also increases the risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.Endomyocardial biopsy data have demonstrated that the cellular morphological changes in patients who received doxorubicin and who were previously treated with cardiac or mediastinal XRT are markedly different and more severe than in treated patients without a history of cardiac or mediastinal XRT.  Prior cardiac or mediastinal  XRT appears to portend a higher risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Oncologic side effects including secondary leukemia have been associated with prior exposure to doxorubicin.  A single case of skin cancer that developed at the site of doxorubicin extravasation 10 years prior has also been reported.
