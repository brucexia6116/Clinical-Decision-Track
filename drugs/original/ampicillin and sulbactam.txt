Common (1% to 10%): DiarrheaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Nausea, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitisFrequency not reported: Pancreatitis, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitisPostmarketing reports: Gastritis, stomatitis, black "hairy" tongue, Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Hypersensitivity reactions to ampicillin (including urticarial rash, edema, hypotension, fever, eosinophilia, dyspnea, delayed hypersensitivity maculopapular rash, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, focal glomerulonephritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)Postmarketing reports: Serious and fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions[Ref]

Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis were generally reversible when therapy was discontinued; may be hypersensitivity events.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased red blood cells, decreased white blood cells, decreased neutrophils, decreased lymphocytes, decreased platelets, increased lymphocytes, increased monocytes, increased basophils, increased eosinophils, increased platelets, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, red cell aplasia, anemia, atypical lymphocytosisPostmarketing reports: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, agranulocytosis, positive direct Coombs test[Ref]
