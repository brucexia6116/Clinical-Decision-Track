Very common (10% or more): Pain at IM injection site (16%)Common (1% to 10%): Pain at IV injection site, thrombophlebitis, phlebitisPostmarketing reports: Injections site reaction
Common (1% to 10%): DiarrheaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Nausea, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal distension, glossitisFrequency not reported: Pancreatitis, enterocolitis, pseudomembranous colitisPostmarketing reports: Gastritis, stomatitis, black "hairy" tongue, Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea
Frequency not reported: Hypersensitivity reactions to ampicillin (including urticarial rash, edema, hypotension, fever, eosinophilia, dyspnea, delayed hypersensitivity maculopapular rash, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, focal glomerulonephritis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)Postmarketing reports: Serious and fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions
Common (1% to 10%): RashUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Itching, facial swelling, erythemaFrequency not reported: Ampicillin-associated bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA dermatosis, pseudoporphyriaPostmarketing reports: Erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis
Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, and agranulocytosis were generally reversible when therapy was discontinued; may be hypersensitivity events.
Frequency not reported: Decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, decreased red blood cells, decreased white blood cells, decreased neutrophils, decreased lymphocytes, decreased platelets, increased lymphocytes, increased monocytes, increased basophils, increased eosinophils, increased platelets, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, red cell aplasia, anemia, atypical lymphocytosisPostmarketing reports: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, agranulocytosis, positive direct Coombs test

Seizures have been reported in very ill patients with high serum levels of ampicillin.  High cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) levels of some penicillins are potentially neurotoxic; the CSF levels of ampicillin rise significantly in meningitis.
