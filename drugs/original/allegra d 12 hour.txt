Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which generally does not produce hypertension, but may be problematic for patients with preexisting hypertension.  Arrhythmias may be produced in predisposed patients.  Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been reported to cause coronary artery spasm and chest pain.One report evaluated the effect with 60 mg of pseudoephedrine on individuals in a hyperbaric chamber at 1 atmosphere (simulated scuba dive to 66 feet of sea water).  Pseudoephedrine and depth (simulated) were found to have significant but opposite effects on heart rate, although these effects were unlikely to be clinically significant during diving.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects have included headache (13%), insomnia (12.6%), dizziness (1.9%), agitation (1.9%), nervousness (1.4%), and anxiety (1.4%).[Ref]
In rare cases, rash urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, flushing and systemic anaphylaxis have been reported.[Ref]
