Some cases of taste disturbance were severe enough to cause decreased food intake, weight loss, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.

An 81-year-old male who had been treated with topical antifungal agents for tinea pedis started this drug (125 mg orally daily) as the lesions did not respond to topical therapy.  He was not taking any other medications and had no history of skin disease.  No other skin lesions were observed at that time.  Two weeks later, he developed erythematous and pustular lesions on his fingers and toes, and an erythematous macular eruption on the limbs.  This drug was discontinued, but the eruptions continued to worsen.  Histopathology of a punch biopsy from his toe showed intraepidermal sterile pustules containing neutrophils, so-called Kogoj's spongiform pustules.  He was then diagnosed with having acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau and was treated with corticosteroids therapy.An 80-year-old female experienced DRESS secondary to severe sialadenitis coincident with this drug.  The patient was admitted with a generalized pruriginous eruption.  She presented with erythematous and edematous widespread confluent plaques, with a scaly annular border.  She had initiated therapy 14 days before onset of the generalized rash, for a nonspecific squamous plaque of the trunk.  DRESS induced by this drug was diagnosed and therapy was discontinued.  Topical therapy was started with 0.5% clobetasol propionate cream applied to the whole body.  The rash progressively improved and blood eosinophilia decreased.A 68-year-old male experienced acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis coincident with this drug.  He presented with a symmetrical maculopapular eruption on both lower anterior legs.  Within 2 days, the rash generalized with facial involvement.  He developed the rash 20 days after initiating oral therapy for onychomycosis.  After withdrawal of this drug, the exanthema abated within 10 days under topical therapy with corticosteroids.Serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis), psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, hair loss, and photosensitivity reactions have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Very common (10% or more): Nonserious forms of skin reactions, rash, urticariaCommon (1% to 10%): Pruritus, erythemaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Photosensitivity reactionsVery rare (less than 0.01%): Serious skin reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis), photosensitivity (e.g., photodermatosis, photosensitivity allergic reaction, polymorphic light eruption), alopecia/hair loss, psoriasiform eruptions or exacerbation of psoriasis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, toxic skin eruptionFrequency not reported: Reversible alopecia areata of the scalp, pustular psoriasis, acrodermatitis continua of HallopeauPostmarketing reports: Serious skin reactions (e.g., drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [DRESS] syndrome)

Liver enzyme abnormalities (at least 2 times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in 3.3% of patients.In most liver failure cases, patients had serious underlying systemic conditions; causal association with this drug was unclear.A 57-year-old male with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection developed drug-induced acute autoimmune hepatitis coincident with this drug.  He was given 250 mg once daily over a 12-week period for dermatophyte toenail onychomycosis.  He developed the side effect just prior to completing the course of therapy.  He was not taking any other drugs or herbal supplements, did not drink alcohol, and did not appear to suffer a flare of HBV infection.  Liver function studies began to normalize 6 weeks after this drug was discontinued.Cases of liver failure (some leading to death or liver transplant), hepatitis, cholestasis, and increased hepatic enzymes have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Common (1% to 10%): Liver enzyme abnormalitiesRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Serious liver dysfunction (including hepatic failure, increased hepatic enzymes, jaundice, cholestasis, liver decompensation, hepatitis), transient increases in liver enzymes, hepatobiliary dysfunction, cholestatic jaundice, liver failure (some cases leading to death or liver transplant)Frequency not reported: Development of idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatobiliary dysfunction, drug-induced autoimmune hepatitisPostmarketing reports: Idiosyncratic and symptomatic hepatic injury

Changes in the ocular lens and retina have been reported; however, the clinical significance is unknown.Dyschromatopsia, whereby the patient reported a greenish hue in her vision, and photopsia have occurred in a patient after 3 weeks of therapy.  This problem resolved within 1 week of discontinuing the drug.
