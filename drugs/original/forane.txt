Gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, and ileus have been observed in the postoperative period.
Isoflurane (the active ingredient contained in Forane) can react with desiccated carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbents to produce carbon monoxide, which may result in elevated levels of carboxyhemoglobin in some patients.
Respiratory side effects including elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels have been reported.
Metabolic side effects including perioperative hyperkalemia have been reported.
Hematologic side effects including transient elevations in white blood count have been reported even in the absence of surgical stress.
