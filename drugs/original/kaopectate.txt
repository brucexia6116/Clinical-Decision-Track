Rare (less than 0.1%): Myoclonic encephalopathy Frequency not reported: Weakness, fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, unsteady gait, motor incoordination, loss of memory, jerky movements, mental confusion, disorientation, difficulty in walking and speaking, tremor, myoclonic jerks, incontinence[Ref]
Nervous system toxicity is a common feature of bismuth toxicity.  Bismuth toxicity is characterized by the insidious onset of weakness and fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, insomnia, unsteady gait, motor incoordination, loss of memory, and jerky movements.  Acute toxicity may result in the development of mental confusion, disorientation, difficulty in walking and speaking, tremor, myoclonic jerks, and incontinence.Myoclonic encephalopathy has occurred in patients who have ingested bismuth for several months to years, but the incidence is very rare.  Recovery of patients from bismuth encephalopathy may take several months following discontinuation of use.  Bismuth encephalopathy has generally been reported in patients ingesting salts other than subsalicylate.[Ref]
Salicylism has been reported in patients who chronically ingest bismuth subsalicylate (the active ingredient contained in Kaopectate)   Common complaints include vertigo, diminished hearing, lethargy, CNS dysfunction, confusion, tinnitus, vomiting, and abdominal pain.  Patients may present with respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis, azotemia, and hypoprothrombinemia and platelet dysfunction.  The elderly may be particularly vulnerable to the development of salicylism.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Salicylism[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Black stoolCommon (1% to 10%): Black tongueFrequency not reported: Nausea, vomiting[Ref]
