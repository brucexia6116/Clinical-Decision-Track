Common side effects of Kepivance include: arthralgia, dysesthesia, edema, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, increased serum amylase, paresthesia, pruritus, skin rash, tongue edema, dysgeusia, erythema, mouth discoloration, and tongue discoloration.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Dermatologic side effects for palifermin (the active ingredient contained in Kepivance) in relation to placebo therapy have included rash (62% vs. 50%), pruritus (35% vs. 24%), and erythema (32% vs. 22%).
Skin rash was the most common serious side effect reported.  Clinical studies (n=409) reported the occurrence of grade 3 skin rash in 14 patients (9 palifermin, 5 placebo) resulting in the discontinuation of treatment in 7 patients (5 palifermin, 2 placebo).Following the first 3 consecutive days of administration, the median time to cutaneous side effects is 6 days with a median duration of 5 days.
Following the first 3 consecutive days of administration, the median time to cutaneous side effects, including edema, is 6 days with a median duration of 5 days.
Other side effects for palifermin in relation to placebo therapy have included edema (28% vs. 21%), pain (16% vs. 11%), fever (39% vs. 34%) and perianal pain (12% vs. 5%).  Other side effects of palifermin following a single 90 mcg/kg IV dose include fatigue (26%) and headache (23%).
Gastrointestinal side effects for palifermin (the active ingredient contained in Kepivance) in relation to placebo therapy have included mouth/tongue thickness and/or discoloration (17% vs. 8%) and altered taste (16% vs. 8%).  Oral/perioral dysesthesia and white film coating of the mouth or tongue has also been reported.
Musculoskeletal side effects for palifermin (the active ingredient contained in Kepivance) in relation to placebo therapy have included arthralgia (10% vs 5%).
Dysthesias in palifermin (the active ingredient contained in Kepivance) treated patients have generally been reported as localized to the perioral region.  In contrast, patients receiving placebo have generally reported dysthesias in extremities.
Nervous system side effects for palifermin in relation to placebo therapy have included dysthesias (12% vs. 7%).  Types of dysthesias reported have included hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, and paresthesia.
There are no available data on the effects of palifermin (the active ingredient contained in Kepivance) on stimulation of KGF receptor- expressing, non- hematopoietic tumors in patients.At concentrations greater than 15 times the average therapeutic human concentration palifermin has been reported to enhance the growth of human epithelial tumor cell lines in vitro.In nude mouse xenograft models, doses 25 and 67 times higher than the recommended human dose administered daily for 3 consecutive weeks and repeated weekly for 4 to 6 weeks may have resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the growth rate of 1 of 7 KGF receptor- expressing human tumor cell lines.
Oncologic side effects have included enhancement in the growth of human epithelial tumor cell lines in vitro and an increase in the rate of tumor cell line growth in a human carcinoma xenograft model.
In clinical studies, the elevated serum lipase and amylase levels were reversible with peak increases recorded during the period of cytotoxic therapy.  Levels returned to baseline by the day of PBPC infusion.  There are no reports of required treatment intervention.The increased amount of amylase is reported to be predominantly salivary in origin.
Metabolic side effects for palifermin in relation to placebo therapy have included elevated serum lipase grade 3 (28% vs. 23%), elevated serum lipase grade 4 (11% vs. 5%), elevated serum amylase grade 3 (62% vs. 54%), and elevated serum amylase grade 4 (38% vs. 31%).
Cardiovascular side effects have included hypertension.
Hypertension was reported with doses of 60 mcg/kg and 80 mcg/kg in patients undergoing hematopoietic transplantation.  This effect appeared to be transient.  There are no reports of treatment discontinuation due to hypertension.
There have been reports of 2+ or greater proteinuria in patients treated with palifermin (the active ingredient contained in Kepivance)  however, a causal relationship between palifermin and proteinuria has not been established.
Genitourinary side effects have included proteinuria.
In general, doses of 80 mcg/kg administered intravenously 3 doses prior to and 3 doses after myeloablative chemotherapy/TBI produced the same type of side effects seen with 60 mcg/kg doses; however, a higher level of severity was reported with the higher dose.
Respiratory side effects for palifermin (the active ingredient contained in Kepivance) in relation to placebo therapy have included cough (34% vs. 28%) and rhinitis (17% vs. 9%).
