Common side effects of Pexeva include: asthenia, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, ejaculatory disorder, erectile dysfunction, insomnia, male genital disease, nausea, headache, decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, diaphoresis, and xerostomia. Other side effects include: infection, blurred vision, female genital tract disease, impotence, lack of concentration, orgasm disturbance, tremor, vasodilatation, visual disturbance, anxiety, paresthesia, abnormal dreams, decreased appetite, and yawning.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, paroxetine (the active ingredient contained in Pexeva) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking paroxetine, check with your doctor immediately:
Some paroxetine side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Side effects are generally reported as mild.  The most common side effects associated with treatment discontinuation in clinical trials included somnolence, insomnia, agitation, tremor, anxiety, dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth, vomiting, flatulence, asthenia, abnormal ejaculation, sweating, impotence, and decreased libido.The most common dose-dependent side effects associated with treatment discontinuation in clinical trials for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder with controlled-release paroxetine (the active ingredient contained in Pexeva) 25 mg compared with 12.5 mg included nausea, somnolence, impaired concentration, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, sweating, tremor, and yawn.The most common side effects associated with treatment discontinuation in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in clinical trials included abdominal pain, attention disturbances, headache, and suicidal ideation.In a placebo-controlled study in elderly patients with major depressive disorder, the most common side effects associated with treatment discontinuation of controlled-release paroxetine included nausea, headache, depression, and abnormal LFTs.There may be adaptation to some side effects (such as nausea and dizziness) but not to others (such as dry mouth, somnolence, and asthenia) with continued therapy.  Paroxetine is less likely than tricyclic antidepressants to be associated with dry mouth, constipation, and somnolence.
Very common (10% or more): InsomniaCommon (1% to 10%): Abnormal dreams, agitation, anxiety, depersonalization, depression, drugged feeling, emotional lability, lack of emotion, nervousnessUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Abnormal thinking, alcohol abuse, bruxism, euphoria, hallucinations, hostility, lack of emotion, manic reaction, neurosis, paranoid reactionRare (less than 0.1%): Abnormal electroencephalogram, antisocial reaction, bulimia, delirium, delusions, drug dependence, hysteria, irritability, manic-depressive reaction, panic attacks, psychosis, psychotic depression, stupor, withdrawal syndromeFrequency not reported: Suicidal ideation and behaviorPostmarketing reports: Confusional state, disorientation, homicidal ideation, restlessness
Antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.  An increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 18 to 24 years) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders has been reported with short-term use of antidepressant drugs.Adult and pediatric patients receiving antidepressants for MDD, as well as for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric indications, have reported symptoms that may be precursors to emerging suicidality, including anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania.  Causality has not been established.Pooled results from clinical trials report hallucinations in 22 of 9089 patients who received paroxetine and 4 of 3187 patients who received placebo.
Extrapyramidal symptoms such as akathisia, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dystonia, hypertonia, and oculogyric crisis have been associated with concomitant pimozide therapy.Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs as monotherapy, but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs and drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin.  Signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome included agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, diarrhea, fever, hypertension, rigidity, and tachycardia, and were in some cases associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs.

The results of one study appear to indicate that treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (i.e., paroxetine (the active ingredient contained in Pexeva)  sertraline, citalopram) may cause an increase in serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and/or LDL cholesterol.  However, additional studies are necessary to confirm these findings.Numerous cases of hyponatremia have been reported following treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  Risk factors for the development of SSRI- associated hyponatremia including advanced age, female gender, concomitant use of diuretics, low body weight, and lower baseline serum sodium levels have been identified.  Hyponatremia tends to develop within the first few weeks of treatment (range 3 to 120 days) and typically resolves within 2 weeks (range 48 hours to 6 weeks) after therapy has been discontinued with some patients requiring treatment.  The proposed mechanism for the development of hyponatremia involves the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) via release of antidiuretic hormone.
Common (1% to 10%): Decreased appetite, increased appetite, increases in cholesterol levels, weight gain, weight lossUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, thirstRare (less than 0.1%): Alkaline phosphatase increased, creatinine phosphokinase increased, dehydration, diabetes mellitus, gamma globulins increased, gout, hypercalcemia, hypercholesteremia, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, ketosis, lactic dehydrogenase increased, non-protein nitrogen increased, obesity Postmarketing reports: Porphyria

There are several reports of priapism associated with paroxetine use.  In cases in which outcome was reported, all patients fully recovered.In placebo-controlled clinical trials, ejaculatory disturbance in men was reported in 13% to 28% of men taking paroxetine, compared to 0% to 2% in the placebo group.  Decreased libido was reported in 6% to 15% in men treated with paroxetine, compared to 0% to 5% in the placebo group, and in 0% to 9% in women treated with paroxetine, compared with 0% to 2% in placebo patients.  The estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance may underestimate their actual incidence, partly because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss this issue.
Seven cases of alopecia have been reported.  In all cases, hair loss was eventually reversible.A case of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been reported following treatment with paroxetine (the active ingredient contained in Pexeva)   The patient originally developed the lesions after treatment with escitalopram.  The lesions disappeared one week following discontinuation of escitalopram and reappeared upon rechallenge.  When the patient was switched to paroxetine a similar reaction occurred.
