As well as its needed effects, thyroid desiccated (the active ingredient contained in WP Thyroid) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Excessive doses may result in a hypermetabolic state resembling in every respect the condition of endogenous origin.
If sings and symptoms of overdosage appear, the dosage should be reduced or therapy temporarily discontinued.  Treatment may be reinstituted at a lower dosage.  Normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function has been restored in 6 to 8 weeks after thyroid suppression.
It is possible that some side effects of WP Thyroid may not have been reported. These can be reported to the FDA here. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
