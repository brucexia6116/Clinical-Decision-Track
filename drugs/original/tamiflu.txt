Influenza can be associated with various neurologic and behavioral symptoms (including hallucinations, delirium, abnormal behavior), with fatal outcomes in some cases; such events may occur with encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease.  There are postmarketing reports (mostly in Japan) of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, with fatal outcomes in some cases, in influenza patients using this drug.  Although frequency is unknown, based on usage, these events appear uncommon.  These events were primarily reported in pediatric patients, often with abrupt onset and rapid resolution.  The contribution of this drug to such events has not been established.Side effects with similar or higher incidence among placebo patients included insomnia.[Ref]
