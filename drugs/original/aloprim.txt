The most commonly reported adverse reactions include skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminase elevation.[Ref]
Skin rash is one of the most common adverse reactions and may occur at any time during treatment.  Some skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal.  In patients with the most severe reactions, systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, arthralgia, cholestatic jaundice, eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis, or leukopenia accompany the rash.  Among 55 patients with gout who received this drug for an average of 1 year (3 to 34 months), 3% developed pruritic maculopapular skin eruptions, sometimes scaly or exfoliative.  The incidence of skin rash appears to be greater in patients with renal insufficiency.  Angioedema has been reported with and without signs and symptoms of a more generalized hypersensitivity reaction.  Skin reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and/or eosinophilia resembling Stevens-Johnson and/or Lyell syndromes have occurred rarely.  Associated vasculitis and tissue responses may manifest as hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and very rarely epilepsy.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Rash, maculopapular rashUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Ecchymosis Rare (less than 0.1%): Steven-Johnson syndrome, Lyell syndromeVery rare (less than 0.01%): Alopecia, discolored hair, angioedema, fixed drug eruptionFrequency not reported: DRESS (Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), sweating[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Generalized hypersensitivityVery rare (less than 0.01%): Anaphylaxis, angioedemaFrequency not reported: Hypersensitivity reaction[Ref]
Generalized hypersensitivity including skin reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and/or eosinophilia resembling Stevens-Johnson and/or Lyell syndromes have occurred rarely.  Associated vasculitis and tissue responses may manifest as hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and very rarely epilepsy.  When generalized hypersensitivity reactions have occurred, renal and or/hepatic disorders have often been present, particularly when the outcome has been fatal.  Angioedema has been reported with and without signs and symptoms of a more generalized hypersensitivity reaction.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Increases in alkaline phosphatase and serum transaminasesRare (less than 0.1%): Hepatic dysfunction including hepatitis (hepatic necrosis and granulomatous hepatitis), hepatomegaly, cholestatic jaundice, Frequency not reported: Clinical hepatotoxicity, liver failure[Ref]
Liver failure was reported in less than 1% of patients.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, nausea, vomitingRare (less than 0.1%): Intermittent abdominal pain, gastritis, dyspepsiaVery rare (less than 0.01%): Steatorrhea, recurrent hematemesis, stomatitis, changed bowel habitFrequency not reported: Hemorrhagic pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, salivary gland swelling, tongue edema, anorexia, flatulence[Ref]

Very rare (less than 0.01%): Leukocytosis, leukopenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemiaFrequency not reported: Bone marrow depression, eosinophilic fibrohistiocytic lesion of bone marrow, pancytopenia, anemia, hemolytic anemia, reticulocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Renal failure/insufficiencyVery rare (less than 0.01%): Xanthine crystalluria, azotemia[Ref]
Xanthine crystalluria has been reported in 3 patients; 2 patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and 1 patient with lymphosarcoma who produced an extremely large amount of uric acid during chemotherapy.  Increased serum creatinine and kidney function abnormality has been reported in less than 1% of patients.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): HeadacheVery rare (less than 0.01%): Ataxia, somnolence, coma, paralysis, paresthesia, neuropathy, taste perversion, neuritisFrequency not reported: Drowsiness, confusion, foot drop, seizure, status epilepticus, myoclonus, twitching, cerebral infarction, stroke, tremor[Ref]

Early clinical experience with this drug found acute gouty attacks on therapy initiation to be one of the more commonly observed adverse reactions; however, current use analyses suggests this incidence is now less than 1%.  The reason for this change has not been determined, but it may be due to patients initiating therapy more gradually.  Hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, electrolyte abnormality, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, water intoxication, and hypomagnesemia have been reported in less than 1% of patients.[Ref]
