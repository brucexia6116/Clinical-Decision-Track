The most commonly reported adverse events included somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Increase weight, increased appetite, decreased appetiteFrequency not reported: Increase in blood sugar levels[Ref]
In uncontrolled, long-term schizophrenia trials, this drug was associated with a mean increase in glucose from baseline of 1.8 mg/dL at 24 weeks, 0.8 mg/dL at 36 weeks, and 2.3 mg/dL at 52 weeks.  Similar results were observed in bipolar depression studies.  The proportion of lurasidone-treated patients with a 7% or greater increase in body weight was 4.8% (compared with 3.3% for placebo).  Pooled data from short-term trials showed a mean weight gain of 0.43 kg in lurasidone-treated patients (compared with -0.2 kg in placebo).[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (up to 17%)Common (1% to 10%): Vomiting, dyspepsia, salivary hypersecretion, dry mouth, diarrheaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Abdominal pain, diarrheaRare (less than 0.1%): GastritisFrequency not reported: Dysphagia[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Somnolence (up to 26%), akathisia (up to 22%), extrapyramidal disorder (up to 22%)Common (1% to 10%): Dizziness, dystoniaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Cerebrovascular accident, dysarthria, seizuresFrequency not reported: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, gait disturbance[Ref]
Akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms were dose-related.[Ref]

In short-term trials, orthostatic hypotension and syncope were reported in 0.3% and 0.1% (n=1508) of patients in schizophrenia studies.  There were no reports in the bipolar depression monotherapy trials.  ECG measurements taken at various points during clinical trials found no QT prolongations exceeding 500 milliseconds (ms) including a subset of patients defined as having an increased cardiac risk.  In a dedicated QT study in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n=87), the maximum mean increase in QTc was 0.36 ms and 1.69 ms for a 120 mg and 600 mg dose, respectively.  No patient experienced a QTc increase of greater than 60 ms from baseline and no patient experienced a QTc greater than 500 ms.[Ref]

The proportion of female patients and male patients with elevations of 5 x ULN or greater was 5.7% and 1.6%, respectively.[Ref]
