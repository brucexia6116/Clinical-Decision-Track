Eosinophilia was reported in 7.5% of 1 study population.  Leukopenia and neutropenia have been reported in up to 1% of patients.  Hemolytic anemia has sometimes been associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.Leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, prothrombin time prolongation, and thrombocytopenia have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Common (1% to 10%): Eosinophilia, decreased WBC, decreased neutrophil count, decreased platelet countUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Decreased hematocrit, decreased hemoglobin, increased eosinophils, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, prothrombin time prolongationRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Hemolytic anemiaPostmarketing reports: AgranulocytosisQuinolones:-Postmarketing reports: Agranulocytosis, prothrombin time prolongation

Quinolones, including this drug, have been associated with ruptures of the shoulder, hand, Achilles, and other tendons resulting in disability or requiring surgical repair.  Elderly patients and patients concomitantly using corticosteroids may be at increased risk.Renal transplant patients have an increased risk of Achilles tendinitis and rupture over the general population.  Quinolone use has been shown to increase that risk further in this population (12% in quinolone-treated patients versus 7% in patients not treated).There have been 23 reports of tendinitis submitted to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Committee (ADRAC) between 2006 and 2008, including reports of Achilles tendonitis, tendon rupture, and tendon pain and swelling.  The reports were primarily in male patients (15 cases) older than 56 years who used ciprofloxacin for 2 to 14 days.  In 19 of the reported cases, a fluoroquinolone (generally ciprofloxacin) was the primary suspect; however, details of concomitant serious medical conditions were not documented in most of the reports.Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also been reported during postmarketing experience.

Rash, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, pruritus, and exfoliative dermatitis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.  Rash has been reported as the most common side effect during postmarketing experience.A 70-year-old male developed systemic contact dermatitis, an itchy papulopustular eruption from the thighs to the abdomen, after 3 days of therapy with this drug.  The patient was treated with prednisone for 15 days.  A patch test 1 month later resulted in a reaction to quinolone mix.Photosensitivity has been reported in patients extensively exposed to sunlight or sunbeds during ongoing therapy with quinolone-like agents.
Crystalluria has occurred in patients taking doses greater than 1200 mg/day and whose urine pH was 7 to 7.8.Crystalluria and vaginal candidiasis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
