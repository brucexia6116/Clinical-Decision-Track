Some triamcinolone nasal side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Triamcinolone nasal (the active ingredient contained in Nasacort AQ) has been generally well tolerated and, due to the nature of its administration, has not been inclined to produce the systemic adverse effects generally associated with the use of corticosteroids.
The central nervous system side effect of headache has been reported in 18% of patients.
Respiratory side effects have included nasal irritation, pharyngitis, dry mucous membranes, burning and stinging, congestion, epistaxis, sneezing, and rarely, nasal septal perforations.
Endocrine side effects have included rare reports of suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis.  The risk of adrenal suppression is less than that associated with systemic corticosteroids and is generally only of concern when using higher than recommended doses or in patients who may be particularly sensitive.
Ocular adverse effects are more commonly seen with systemic administration of corticosteroids.  However, posterior capsular cataracts have been occasionally reported with triamcinolone, especially with long-term use.  In addition, prolonged use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids ( >= 440 mcg of triamcinolone nasal (the active ingredient contained in Nasacort AQ)  may be associated with increased risk of ocular hypertension and open angle glaucoma.
It is possible that some side effects of Nasacort AQ may not have been reported. These can be reported to the FDA here. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
