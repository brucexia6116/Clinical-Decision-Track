The more common side effects include increased serum creatinine, headache, influenza, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.[Ref]
When used at labeled doses in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), serum creatinine increases of 1.5 to less than 2 times or 2 times or greater from baseline occurred in 3.9% (n=20/511) and 1.8% (n=9/511) of patients, respectively.  Increased serum creatinine levels resolved in most patients (up to 90%) without treatment interruption.  Based on baseline renal function, serum creatinine increases occurred in 3%, 3.8%, and 6.9% of patients with normal (CrCl greater than 90 mL/min), mild (CrCl 60 to less than 90 mL/min), or moderate (CrCl greater than 30 to less than 60 mL/min) renal impairment.Use at higher than approved doses with or without an XOI resulted in increased serum creatinine levels.  Consistently, patients receiving 400 mg daily as monotherapy experienced a higher incidence of renal failure.  Nephrolithiasis occurred more frequently in patients receiving 400 mg daily in combination with an XOI (2.5%) compared to labeled doses in combination with an XOI (0.6%).[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Increased serum creatinine, renal failureUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Nephrolithiasis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Headache[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Influenza[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Gastroesophageal reflux disease[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke[Ref]
Incidence rate ratios for major adverse cardiac events compared to placebo were 1.36 (95% CI: 0.23, 9.25) in 200 mg and 2.71 (95% CI: 0.66, 16) in 400 mg.[Ref]
