Commonly reported side effects of somatropin include: upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, arthropathy, headache, hypoesthesia, increased serum glucose, limb pain, myalgia, paresthesia, and peripheral edema. Other side effects include: fatigue, fluid retention, gynecomastia, hyperglycemia, insomnia, joint stiffness, joint swelling, nausea, and anasarca.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, somatropin may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some somatropin side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
