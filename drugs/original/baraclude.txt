More frequent side effects include: glycosuria, hematuria, increased serum aspartate aminotransferase, and increased serum lipase.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most common side effects reported in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and compensated liver disease during clinical trials have included headache, fatigue, dizziness, and nausea.  One percent of patients discontinued therapy due to side effects or laboratory abnormalities (compared to 4% of lamivudine-treated patients).The most common side effects reported in patients with chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation (n=102) through Week 48 of a study have included peripheral edema, ascites, pyrexia, hepatic encephalopathy, and upper respiratory infection.  The cumulative death rate was 23% with entecavir (the active ingredient contained in Baraclude) during the first 48 weeks of therapy (compared to 33% with adefovir).  The majority of deaths were due to liver-related causes such as hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.  Through Week 48, up to 7% of patients discontinued this drug due to a side effect.
Very common (10% or more): Elevated ALT (up to 12%), posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis/ALT flare (up to 12%), deaths due to liver-related causes (e.g., hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage; 11%), hepatic encephalopathy (10%)Common (1% to 10%): On-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis/ALT flaresFrequency not reported: Elevated AST, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (including fatal cases), severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (after discontinuation of therapy)Postmarketing reports: Increased transaminases
Elevated ALT (greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times baseline: up to 2%; greater than 5 times ULN: up to 12%; greater than 3 times baseline: up to 5%; greater than 2 times baseline [with total bilirubin greater than 2 times ULN and greater than 2 times baseline]: up to 1%) and total bilirubin (greater than 2.5 times ULN; up to 3%) have been reported.Posttreatment exacerbations of hepatitis or ALT flare, as defined by ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times baseline, have been reported in patients who discontinued therapy at or after 52 weeks after achieving a defined treatment response (nucleoside-naive HBeAg-positive: 2%; nucleoside-naive HBeAg-negative: 8%; lamivudine-refractory: 12%).  The median time to exacerbation was 23 to 24 weeks.  The rate may be higher in patients who discontinue this drug without regard to treatment response.Hepatic encephalopathy and deaths due to liver-related causes (such as hepatic failure, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage) were reported in patients with hepatic decompensation.
Decreased albumin (less than 2.5 g/dL) and platelets (less than 50,000/mm3) were reported in 30% and 20% of patients with hepatic decompensation, respectively.
Very common (10% or more): Decreased albumin (up to 30%), decreased platelets (up to 20%)
Very common (10% or more): Elevated lipase (up to 18%)Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, elevated amylaseFrequency not reported: Abdominal pain (unspecified), upper abdominal pain, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage
Elevated lipase (greater than 3 times baseline: up to 18%; at least 2.1 times upper limit of normal [ULN]: 7%) and amylase (greater than 3 times baseline: 2%) have been reported.
Very common (10% or more): Peripheral edema (16%), ascites (15%), pyrexia/fever (14%)Common (1% to 10%): FatigueFrequency not reported: Accidental injury, influenza
Peripheral edema, ascites, and pyrexia were reported in patients with hepatic decompensation.
Very common (10% or more): Hepatocellular carcinoma (up to 12%)Frequency not reported: Malignant neoplasms
Hepatocellular carcinoma was reported in patients with hepatic decompensation.Malignant neoplasms, occurring at a rate of 8.4 per 1000 patient-years, have been reported.
Confirmed creatinine increase of at least 0.5 mg/dL was reported in up to 2% of patients with compensated liver disease.  Confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL (11%) and renal failure were reported in patients with hepatic decompensation.
Very common (10% or more): Increased serum creatinine (up to 11%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Renal failure
Very common (10% or more): Upper respiratory infection (10%)Frequency not reported: Cough, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis
Upper respiratory infection was reported in patients with hepatic decompensation.
Common (1% to 10%): Elevated fasting hyperglycemia, decreased blood bicarbonateFrequency not reported: Elevated alkaline phosphatasePostmarketing reports: Lactic acidosis
Elevated fasting hyperglycemia (greater than 250 mg/dL) was reported in up to 3% of patients.Decreased blood bicarbonate was reported in patients with hepatic decompensation.Lactic acidosis was often associated with hepatic decompensation, other serious medical conditions, or drug exposures.
Common (1% to 10%): Hematuria, glycosuriaFrequency not reported: Dysuria
Grade 3 to 4 hematuria (9%) and glycosuria (4%) were reported.
Common (1% to 10%): Headache, dizziness, somnolence
