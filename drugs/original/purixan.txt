As well as its needed effects, mercaptopurine (the active ingredient contained in Purixan) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some mercaptopurine side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Hematologic effects including myelosuppression have been reported.  Myelosuppression is the most frequent adverse reaction reported with the use of mercaptopurine (the active ingredient contained in Purixan)   Anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia have also been reported frequently.
Hyperuricemia may occur as a consequence of rapid cell lysis.  Adverse effects may be minimized by increasing hydration, urine alkalinization, and the prophylactic administration of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (such as allopurinol).
Renal effects including hyperuricemia have been reported.
Gastrointestinal effects including intestinal ulceration have been reported.  Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia have been infrequently reported during initial administration.  Mild diarrhea and sprue-like symptoms have been reported occasionally.  Oral lesions have been reported rarely.  An increased risk of pancreatitis may be associated with the investigational use of mercaptopurine (the active ingredient contained in Purixan) in inflammatory bowel disease.
The mild diarrhea and sprue-like symptoms are not necessarily related to the mercaptopurine. Oral lesions resemble thrush rather than antifolic ulcerations.
Hepatic effects including a small number of deaths which may have been attributed to hepatic necrosis have been reported.
Dermatologic effects have included skin rashes, alopecia, and hyperpigmentation.
Genitourinary side effects including oligospermia have been reported.
Other effects including drug fever have been reported very rarely.
Before the drug fever is assumed to be caused by mercaptopurine, the clinician should exclude more common causes of pyrexia such as sepsis in patients with acute leukemia.
Oncologic side effects have included hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma.
It is possible that some side effects of Purixan may not have been reported. These can be reported to the FDA here. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
