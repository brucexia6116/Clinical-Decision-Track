Respiratory depression has been associated with antitussive use of codeine in young children.  Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine in the postoperative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.  Further investigation has shown these patients to be ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.  Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine appear to be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.[Ref]
