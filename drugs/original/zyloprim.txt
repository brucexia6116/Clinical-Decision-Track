More frequent side effects include: acute gout attack.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, allopurinol (the active ingredient contained in Zyloprim) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some allopurinol side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most commonly reported adverse reactions include skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminase elevation.
Skin rash is one of the most common adverse reactions and may occur at any time during treatment.  Some skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal.  In patients with the most severe reactions, systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, arthralgia, cholestatic jaundice, eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis, or leukopenia accompany the rash.  Among 55 patients with gout who received this drug for an average of 1 year (3 to 34 months), 3% developed pruritic maculopapular skin eruptions, sometimes scaly or exfoliative.  The incidence of skin rash appears to be greater in patients with renal insufficiency.  Angioedema has been reported with and without signs and symptoms of a more generalized hypersensitivity reaction.  Skin reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and/or eosinophilia resembling Stevens-Johnson and/or Lyell syndromes have occurred rarely.  Associated vasculitis and tissue responses may manifest as hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and very rarely epilepsy.
Common (1% to 10%): Rash, maculopapular rashUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Ecchymosis Rare (less than 0.1%): Steven-Johnson syndrome, Lyell syndromeVery rare (less than 0.01%): Alopecia, discolored hair, angioedema, fixed drug eruptionFrequency not reported: DRESS (Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms), sweating
Rare (less than 0.1%): Generalized hypersensitivityVery rare (less than 0.01%): Anaphylaxis, angioedemaFrequency not reported: Hypersensitivity reaction
Generalized hypersensitivity including skin reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and/or eosinophilia resembling Stevens-Johnson and/or Lyell syndromes have occurred rarely.  Associated vasculitis and tissue responses may manifest as hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and very rarely epilepsy.  When generalized hypersensitivity reactions have occurred, renal and or/hepatic disorders have often been present, particularly when the outcome has been fatal.  Angioedema has been reported with and without signs and symptoms of a more generalized hypersensitivity reaction.
Common (1% to 10%): Increases in alkaline phosphatase and serum transaminasesRare (less than 0.1%): Hepatic dysfunction including hepatitis (hepatic necrosis and granulomatous hepatitis), hepatomegaly, cholestatic jaundice, Frequency not reported: Clinical hepatotoxicity, liver failure
Liver failure was reported in less than 1% of patients.
Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, nausea, vomitingRare (less than 0.1%): Intermittent abdominal pain, gastritis, dyspepsiaVery rare (less than 0.01%): Steatorrhea, recurrent hematemesis, stomatitis, changed bowel habitFrequency not reported: Hemorrhagic pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, salivary gland swelling, tongue edema, anorexia, flatulence

Eosinophilic fibrohistiocytic lesion of bone marrow, pancytopenia, anemia, hemolytic anemia, reticulocytosis, lymphadenopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and lymphocytosis were reported in less than 1% of patients.
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Leukocytosis, leukopenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemiaFrequency not reported: Bone marrow depression, eosinophilic fibrohistiocytic lesion of bone marrow, pancytopenia, anemia, hemolytic anemia, reticulocytosis, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation
Common (1% to 10%): Renal failure/insufficiencyVery rare (less than 0.01%): Xanthine crystalluria, azotemia
Xanthine crystalluria has been reported in 3 patients; 2 patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and 1 patient with lymphosarcoma who produced an extremely large amount of uric acid during chemotherapy.  Increased serum creatinine and kidney function abnormality has been reported in less than 1% of patients.
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): HeadacheVery rare (less than 0.01%): Ataxia, somnolence, coma, paralysis, paresthesia, neuropathy, taste perversion, neuritisFrequency not reported: Drowsiness, confusion, foot drop, seizure, status epilepticus, myoclonus, twitching, cerebral infarction, stroke, tremor
Confusion, foot drop, seizure, status epilepticus, myoclonus, twitching, cerebral infarction, stroke, and tremor were reported in less than 1% of patients.
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Visual disorder, cataract, macular changesFrequency not reported: Optic neuritis
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Furunculosis, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increase in acute gout attacksVery rare (less than 0.01%): Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemiaFrequency not reported: Hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, electrolyte abnormality, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, water intoxication, hypomagnesemia
Early clinical experience with this drug found acute gouty attacks on therapy initiation to be one of the more commonly observed adverse reactions; however, current use analyses suggests this incidence is now less than 1%.  The reason for this change has not been determined, but it may be due to patients initiating therapy more gradually.  Hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, electrolyte abnormality, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, water intoxication, and hypomagnesemia have been reported in less than 1% of patients.
