Commonly reported side effects of flutamide include: diarrhea.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Applies to flutamide: oral capsule, oral tablet
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by flutamide. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking flutamide:

If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking flutamide, get emergency help immediately:

Some of the side effects that can occur with flutamide may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to flutamide: oral capsule
In general, flutamide has been used concomitantly with LHRH agonists or after bilateral orchiectomy.  Therefore, little data are available on the side effects of flutamide alone.[Ref]
Nineteen cases of severe flutamide related hepatotoxicity were reported by the FDA in 1993.  The flutamide related hepatitis developed 56 to 80 days after the beginning of therapy and was mainly cytolytic.  Four of the cases involved massive hepatic necrosis with fatal outcomes.  The mechanism of action was believed to be direct hepatotoxicity.In a study of 1,091 patients with prostate cancer treated with flutamide and an LHRH agonist, four patients (0.36%) developed severe hepatotoxicity in the first four weeks of therapy.  Serum aminotransferases increased more than four times normal values.  Alkaline phosphatase increased more than six times normal values in one patient.  Total bilirubin was elevated in two patients.  Only two patients developed clinical manifestations, including fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting.  None of the remaining 1,089 patients had significant elevations in liver function tests although transient, mild elevations in AST and ALT occasionally occurred.In most cases, discontinuation of flutamide results in resolution of symptoms.A case of fatal liver complications has been reported where the drug was prescribed for an 18 year old woman for the treatment of minor acne and hirsutism.  The risk of lethal hepatic complications makes the risk-benefit ratio unacceptable when flutamide is being considered to treat disorders such as polycystic ovaries, and especially for benign complaints such as alopecia, hirsutism, and acne.[Ref]
Hepatic side effects have included elevations in serum transaminases as well as cases of cholestatic jaundice, hepatic necrosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and fatal hepatotoxicity.[Ref]
Hematologic side effects have included anemia (6%), leukopenia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (1%).  Flutamide has also been implicated in cases of methemoglobinemia, sulphemoglobinemia and neutropenia.  In addition, eosinophilia has been reported in association with some cases of hepatotoxicity.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects have been reported in less than 1% of patients and include drowsiness, dizziness, sedation, and confusion.[Ref]
Renal side effects including renal failure (in association with severe hepatotoxicity) have been reported.[Ref]
Cardiovascular side effects reported include hypertension (1%), thromboembolism, and edema.[Ref]
Pseudoporphyria (blisters, increased skin fragility, and erosions in sun-exposed areas) was reported in a 68-year-old man being treated for prostate cancer with appropriate doses of flutamide and goserelin.  The patient presented with skin fragility and blisters on the back of the hands.   After replacing the flutamide with bicalutamide, the lesions healed.[Ref]
Dermatologic side effects including rash (3%), alopecia, sweating, and cases of photosensitivity/photoallergy have been reported.   One case of flutamide-induced pseudoporphyria has also been reported.[Ref]
Endocrine side effects including hot flashes (29% to 63%), gynecomastia (up to 19%), fever, and breast tenderness (7%) have been reported.[Ref]
Two female patients receiving flutamide for the treatment of bulimia nervosa noted decreased symptoms within a week after initiation of therapy.  Both patients relapsed after the drug was later withdrawn.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects including mucositis, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, and either weight loss or gain have been reported.[Ref]
Musculoskeletal side effects including muscle cramps in up to 15% of patients have been reported.[Ref]
Psychiatric side effects including depression, anxiety, and nervousness have been reported.  One case report of mania has also been reported.[Ref]
Genitourinary side effects including impotence and loss of libido have been reported.[Ref]
Several studies have described a flutamide withdrawal syndrome in which significant reductions in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are noted following the discontinuation of flutamide therapy in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.Several studies have evaluated the effect of concurrent discontinuation of flutamide and initiation of aminoglutethimide therapy in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer.  In one study, serum PSA levels declined by more than 80% for more than four weeks in 14 out of 29 (48%) patients.  Clinical improvement was also noted.  Some authors propose prolonged flutamide therapy may result in the selective proliferation of cancer cell lines with androgen receptors which recognize hydroxyflutamide as an androgenic agonist.  Additional research is needed to fully evaluate this phenomenon.[Ref]
Other side effects have included flutamide withdrawal syndrome.[Ref]
Respiratory side effects including one case of pneumonitis have been reported.[Ref]
