As well as its needed effects, insulin degludec (the active ingredient contained in Tresiba) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some insulin degludec side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most commonly reported adverse reactions include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, pruritus, rash, edema, and weight gain.
Weight gain, attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin, has been reported.  In 52-week clinical trials, an average weight gain of 1.8 kg and 3 kg was reported in patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively.
Very common (10% or more): HypoglycemiaFrequency not reported: Weight gain
In clinical trials, peripheral edema was reported in 3% and 0.9% of patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively.
Common (1% to 10%): Peripheral edema
Common (1% to 10%): Injection site reactions
Injection site reactions have included injection site hematoma, pain, hemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discoluration, pruritus, warmth, and injection site mass.  These reactions are usually mild and transient and disappear with continued treatment.
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hypersensitivity (manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhea, nausea, tiredness, and itching) and urticaria
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Lipodystrophy, urticaria
The incidence of anti-insulin degludec (the active ingredient contained in Tresiba) antibodies has not been established.  The detection of antibodies is dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease.  Therefore, comparison of the incidence of antibodies may be misleading.  In a study in patients with type 1 diabetes, almost 96% of patients were positive for anti-insulin antibodies at least once during the studies, including almost 90% at baseline.
Frequency not reported: Anti-insulin antibodies
Very common (10% or more): Nasopharyngitis (23.9%), upper respiratory tract infection (11.9%)Common (1% to 10%): Sinusitis
Very common (10% or more): Headache (11.8%)
Common (1% to 10%): Gastroenteritis, diarrhea
It is possible that some side effects of Tresiba may not have been reported. These can be reported to the FDA here. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
