Applies to emtricitabine / rilpivirine / tenofovir: oral tablet
During clinical studies, 550 antiretroviral therapy-naive patients received rilpivirine in combination with emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF).  The most common side effects were depression/depressive disorders, nausea, dizziness, abnormal dreams, headache, diarrhea, and insomnia.  Treatment was discontinued due to side effects, regardless of severity, in 2% of patients taking rilpivirine in combination with emtricitabine-tenofovir DF.  The most common side effects leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders.  In virologically-suppressed patients switching to emtricitabine / rilpivirine / tenofovir DF, the most common side effects were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and insomnia.The manufacturer product information for emtricitabine, rilpivirine, and tenofovir DF should be consulted.[Ref]

Increased creatinine (grade 1: 6%; grade 2: 1%; grade 3: less than 1%) has been reported with emtricitabine-tenofovir DF plus rilpivirine.In 2 trials in antiretroviral therapy-naive HIV-1-infected patients (median eGFR 115 mL/min at baseline) using emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide with elvitegravir plus cobicistat, mean serum creatinine increased by 0.1 mg/dL from baseline to week 48; median UPCR was 44 mg/g at baseline and at week 48.  In a trial in virologically-suppressed tenofovir DF-treated patients (mean eGFR 112 mL/min at baseline) who switched to emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide with elvitegravir plus cobicistat, mean serum creatinine was similar to baseline; median UPCR was 61 mg/g at baseline and 46 mg/g at week 48.  In a trial in renal dysfunction patients (baseline eGFR 30 to 69 mL/min) using emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide with elvitegravir plus cobicistat, mean serum creatinine was 1.5 mg/dL at baseline and week 24; median UPCR was 161 mg/g at baseline and 93 mg/g at week 24.During phase 3 trials, an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR were seen over 96 weeks of therapy with rilpivirine.  Most of these changes occurred within the first 4 weeks of therapy, with a mean change of 0.1 mg/dL (range: -0.3 to 0.6 mg/dL) for creatinine and -13.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (range: -63.7 to 40.1 mL/min/1.73 m2) for eGFR observed after 96 weeks of therapy.  In subjects with mild or moderate baseline renal dysfunction, the serum creatinine increase observed was similar to that seen in subjects with normal renal function.  These changes were not considered clinically relevant and no subject discontinued therapy due to increases in serum creatinine.Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after tenofovir DF was stopped; however, decreased CrCl did not completely resolve in some patients after stopping the drug.  Rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures), hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, and hypophosphatemia may occur as a result of proximal renal tubulopathy.Renal failure, acute renal failure, Fanconi syndrome, proximal renal tubulopathy, increased creatinine, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and acute tubular necrosis have also been reported during postmarketing experience with tenofovir DF.[Ref]

Rilpivirine:-Frequency not reported: Decreased basal cortisol, decreased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol levels, adrenal insufficiency, abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation testTenofovir DF:-Frequency not reported: Higher serum parathyroid hormone levels[Ref]
In the pooled phase 3 trials, at week 96, there was an overall mean change from baseline in basal cortisol of -19.1 nmol/L (-0.69 mcg/dL) in the rilpivirine group, and of -0.6 nmol/L (-0.02 mcg/dL) in the efavirenz group.  At week 96, the mean change from baseline in ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels was lower in the rilpivirine group (+18.4 nmol/L) than in the efavirenz group (+54.1 nmol/L).  Mean values for both basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol values at week 96 were within the normal range.In the rilpivirine group, 43 of 588 patients with normal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test (peak cortisol level less than 18.1 mcg/dL) during the trial versus 18 of 561 patients in the efavirenz group.  Abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation test at week 96 was seen in 14 of the 43 rilpivirine patients and 9 of the 18 efavirenz patients.  Clinical significance of abnormal 250 mcg ACTH stimulation tests (or the higher rate in the rilpivirine group) has not been established.Overall, there were no serious side effects, deaths, or treatment discontinuations that could clearly be attributed to adrenal insufficiency.[Ref]
