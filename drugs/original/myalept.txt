In vitro neutralizing activity anti-metreleptin (the active ingredient contained in Myalept) antibodies were identified in 2 patients (n=33) with generalized lipodystrophy who showed severe infections and worsening metabolic control (increases in HbA1c and/or triglycerides).  Three patients with anti-metreleptin antibodies without lipodystrophy showed excessive weight gain, and/or development of glucose intolerance or diabetes.  In clinical trials, anti-metreleptin antibodies were detected in 36 of 43 generalized lipodystrophy patients, with titers ranging from 1:5 to 1:1,953, 125; however, these numbers may be misleading as detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay (the assays utilized in clinical trials lacked sensitivity), handling of the sample, concomitant drugs, and underlying disease.  Due to incompleteness of the immunogenicity data, the clinical significance and the magnitude and persistence of the anti-drug responses are not well characterized.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Autoimmune disorder, immunogenicity[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Arthralgia, back pain[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Pyrexia, ear infection, fatigue[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Proteinuria[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Upper respiratory tract infection[Ref]
Frequency not reported: T-cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma
Three cases of T-cell lymphoma were reported among patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy; 2 patients diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphoma during treatment had immunodeficiency and significant hematologic abnormalities including severe bone marrow abnormalities prior to starting treatment.  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma was reported in 1 patient receiving this drug who did not have hematologic abnormalities before treatment.
