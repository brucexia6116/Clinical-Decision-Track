Commonly reported side effects of paclitaxel include: nausea and vomiting, arthralgia, hypotension, myalgia, alopecia, diarrhea, hypersensitivity, mucositis, skin rash, ecg abnormality, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, increased serum aspartate aminotransferase, infusion site reaction, peripheral neuropathy, and flushing. Other side effects include: severe arthralgia, severe myalgia, and increased serum bilirubin.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, paclitaxel may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some paclitaxel side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
