Hypotension is rare and has been reported most frequently with high doses of codeine.Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which generally does not produce hypertension, but may be problematic for patients with preexisting hypertension.  Arrhythmias may be produced in predisposed patients.  Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been reported to cause coronary artery spasm and chest pain.[Ref]
Codeine Frequency not reported: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, biliary tract spasm, increased colonic motility, toxic dilationGuaifenesin: Frequency not reported: Abdominal pain (upper), diarrhea, nausea, vomitingPseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, ischemic colitis[Ref]
Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis may experience increased colonic motility, while patients with acute ulcerative colitis have experienced toxic dilation with codeine use.[Ref]
Codeine Frequency not reported: Oliguria, urinary retention, antidiuretic effectPseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Urinary retention[Ref]

Respiratory depression has been associated with antitussive use of codeine in young children.  Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine in the postoperative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.  Further investigation has shown these patients to be ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.  Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine appear to be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.
