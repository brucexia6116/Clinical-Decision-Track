Applies to atropine: oral tablets, parenteral injection
Side effects include:
Most adverse effects are manifestations of pharmacologic effects at muscarinic-cholinergic receptors and usually are reversible when therapy is discontinued. 
Severity and frequency of adverse effects are dose related and individual intolerance varies greatly; adverse effects occasionally may be obviated by a reduction in dosage but this also may eliminate potential therapeutic effects.  
Frequent effects include xerostomia (dry mouth), dry skin, blurred vision, cycloplegia, mydriasis, photophobia, anhidrosis, urinary hesitancy and retention, tachycardia, palpitation, xerophthalmia, and constipation,      which may appear at therapeutic or subtherapeutic doses.  Xerostomia is the dose-limiting effect. 
Other common effects include increased ocular tension (especially in patients with angle-closure glaucoma), loss of taste, headache, nervousness, restlessness, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, flushing, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, bloated feeling, anhidrosis (especially in hot environments),    fever,  mild to moderate pain at the injection site,   loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction (via block of cholinergically mediated vasodilation).
