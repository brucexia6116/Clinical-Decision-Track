If any of the following side effects occur while taking amphotericin b liposomal, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
General reactions during amphotericin B liposomal infusions, such as fever and chills/rigors, have been reported.

Metabolic changes have occurred less frequently with amphotericin B liposomal than with conventional amphotericin B.Four patients with invasive fungal infections experienced severe hyperphosphatemia coincident with amphotericin B liposomal therapy.  Resolution of the side effect occurred after transition to amphotericin B lipid complex.  Hyperphosphatemia may be reported more commonly in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.
