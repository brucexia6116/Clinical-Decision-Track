Applies to amphotericin b liposomal: intravenous powder for injection
General reactions during amphotericin B liposomal infusions, such as fever and chills/rigors, have been reported.  These symptoms usually began within a few minutes of initiation of an amphotericin B liposomal infusion.  Slowing the rate of infusion has lessened or controlled symptoms.  Severe infusion-related side effects associated with conventional amphotericin B administration have been lessened by pretreatment/treatment with corticosteroids, acetaminophen, antihistamines, and meperidine.[Ref]

Metabolic changes have occurred less frequently with amphotericin B liposomal than with conventional amphotericin B.Four patients with invasive fungal infections experienced severe hyperphosphatemia coincident with amphotericin B liposomal therapy.
