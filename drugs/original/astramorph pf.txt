Central nervous system side effects may be either depressant or excitatory.  Excitatory symptoms are sometimes ignored as possible side effects of morphine (the active ingredient contained in Astramorph PF)   Severe adverse effects such as respiratory depression can be treated with the opioid antagonist naloxone.Patients receiving continuous infusion of morphine sulfate via indwelling intrathecal catheter should be monitored for new neurologic signs or symptoms.  Further assessment or intervention should be based on the clinical condition of the individual patient.Myoclonic spasms may occur in patients receiving high dose morphine, particularly in the setting of renal dysfunction.  Hyperalgesia has also been reported with high doses.
Very common (10% or more): Drowsiness (28%)Common (1% to 10%): Dizziness, sedation, fever, anxiety, confusion, tremor, diaphoresis, lethargy, feeling of warmthUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Withdrawal symptoms after either abrupt cessation or fast tapering of the drug, headache, chills, flu syndrome, malaise, withdrawal syndrome, pallor, facial flushing, syncope, loss of concentration, insomnia, amnesia, paresthesia, agitation, vertigo, foot drop, ataxia, hypesthesia, slurred speech, hallucinations, euphoria, apathy, seizures, myoclonusFrequency not reported: Inflammatory masses including granulomas (some of which have resulted in serous neurologic impairment including paralysis) in patients receiving continuous infusion of opioids via indwelling intrathecal catheter
Common (1% to 10%): Respiratory depressionUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hiccup, rhinitis, atelectasis, asthma, hypoxia, voice alteration, depressed cough reflex, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, bronchospasm
Morphine may cause constriction of the common bile duct and spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, thereby increasing intrabiliary pressure and worsening, rather than relieving, biliary colic.In addition, morphine (the active ingredient contained in Astramorph PF) may cause intense but uncoordinated duodenal contraction and decreased gastric emptying.
Common (1% to 10%): Dry mouth, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, abdominal pain, vomitingUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Dysphagia, dyspepsia, stomach atony disorder, gastroesophageal reflux, delayed gastric emptying, biliary colic, increased gastroesophageal reflux, intestinal obstruction
Common (1% to 10%): Chest painUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hypotension, palpitations, bradycardia, vasodilation
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Abnormal thinking, abnormal dreams, depression, fearfulness, agitation, paranoia, psychosis, hypervigilance, hallucinations, deliriumFrequency not reported: Withdrawal symptoms after abrupt cessation of therapy
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Urinary abnormality, urinary retention, urinary hesitancy
The risk of acute urinary retention is very high when morphine is administered by epidural or intrathecal injection.  Clinicians should be attentive to the increased risk of urosepsis in this setting, particularly if instrumentation of the urinary tract is necessary.
Common (1% to 10%): Anemia, leukopeniaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Thrombocytopenia
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hyponatremia due to inappropriate ADH secretion, gynecomastia, amenorrhea, reduced libido, reduced potency, prolonged labor
Common (1% to 10%): Asthenia, accidental injuryUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Back pain, bone pain, arthralgiaFrequency not reported: Opioid-induced involuntary muscle hyperactivity with chronic high doses
Common (1% to 10%): RashUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Decubitus ulcer, pruritus, skin flush
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Amblyopia, conjunctivitis, miosis, blurred vision, nystagmus, diplopia
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increases in hepatic enzymes
Common (1% to 10%): Peripheral edemaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hyponatremia
