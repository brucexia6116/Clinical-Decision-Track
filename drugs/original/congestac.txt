 Check with your doctor if any of these most COMMON side effects persist or become bothersome:
Dizziness; excitability; headache; nausea; nervousness or anxiety; trouble sleeping; weakness.
Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); difficulty urinating; fast or irregular heartbeat; hallucinations; seizures; severe dizziness, lightheadedness, or headache; tremor.
Cardiovascular side effects have included significant increases in heart rate.  Hypertension and arrhythmias have also been problematic in susceptible patients.
Pseudoephedrine may cause vasoconstriction which generally does not produce hypertension, but may be problematic for patients with preexisting hypertension.  Arrhythmias may be produced in predisposed patients.  Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been reported to cause coronary artery spasm and chest pain.
Nervous system side effects of pseudoephedrine have included stimulation, resulting in tremor, anxiety, and nervousness.  Insomnia has been reported in up to 30% of pseudoephedrine-treated patients.  Headache has also been reported in patients receiving pseudoephedrine.  Guaifenesin has occasionally caused dizziness and headache.
Gastrointestinal side effects associated with pseudoephedrine have included anorexia and gastric irritation in approximately 5% of patients.  Dry mouth, nose, or throat has occurred in up to 15% of patients.  Gastrointestinal upset and vomiting have been reported with higher than recommended doses of guaifenesin.  Doses recommended for expectoration have rarely been associated with gastrointestinal upset.
Hypersensitivity side effects have included fixed drug eruptions secondary to pseudoephedrine.
Dermatologic side effects have included rare reports of rash.
