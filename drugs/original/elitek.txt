Common side effects of Elitek include: abdominal pain, fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most common adverse reactions reported included vomiting, nausea, pyrexia, peripheral edema, anxiety, headache, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea.  Since this drug is administered concomitantly with cytoreductive chemotherapy, the causality of adverse reactions is difficult to assess due to the significant burden of adverse events expected from the underlying disease and its treatment.
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hemolytic anemia, hemolysis, methemoglobinemia
Clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity have included arthralgia, injection site irritation, peripheral edema, urticaria, and rash.
Common (1% to 10%): Hypersensitivity reactions (rashes and urticaria)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Severe hypersensitivity reactionsRare (less than 0.1%): Anaphylaxis
Very common (10% or more): Anti-rasburicase (the active ingredient contained in Elitek) antibodies, sepsis (up to 12%)
Anti-rasburicase antibodies were measured in 53% of healthy volunteers one month post last dose; most were no longer positive at 1 year.  In clinical trials of pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies 11% (n=24/218) patients developed anti-rasburicase antibodies by day 28 following treatment.  In adult trials, 18% (n=47/260) were positive for anti-rasburicase immunoglobulin G (IgG); 8% were positive for IgG and 6% were positive for IgE from day 14 to 24 months after 1 treatment course (5 daily doses).  All-grade sepsis was reported in 12%, 7.6%, and 4.4% of adult patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumor malignancies receiving rasburicase alone (n=92), rasburicase in combination with allopurinol (n=92), or allopurinol alone (n=91).  Sepsis was grade 3, 4 in 5.4%, 6.5%, and 4.4%, respectively.
