The most common adverse reactions (incidence more than 5% and greater than placebo) were: Upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis.[Ref]
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Churg-Strauss Syndrome[Ref]
Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare granulomatous eosinophilic condition that involves the upper and lower airways and manifests as rhinitis, sinusitis and asthma.  If untreated the syndrome may progress to systemic vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy and potentially fatal cardiac complications.  In most cases, the condition emerged during withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy.  A causative role for leukotriene receptor antagonists has not been ruled out.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Headache (18.4%)Common (1% to 10%): Dizziness (1.9%)Postmarketing reports: Disturbance in attention, irritability, memory impairment, tremor, drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Rash (1.6%), atopic dermatitis, skin infection, eczema, urticariaPostmarketing reports: Angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Abdominal pain (2.9%), dyspepsia (2.1%), dental pain (1.7%), gastroenteritis (1.5%), nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, tooth infection[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): ALT increase (2.1%), AST increased (1.6%)Postmarketing reports: Hepatic eosinophilic infiltration; cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury.  Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Myopia, conjunctivitis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Asthenia, fatigue (1.8%), fever (1.5%), trauma (1%), influenza, fever, otitis, viral infection, varicella, ear pain, otitis mediaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): MalaisePostmarketing reports: Edema[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Influenza (4.2%), cough (2.7%), nasal congestion (1.6%), pharyngitis, sinusitis, laryngitis, infective rhinitis, acute bronchitis, rhinorrhea, pneumonia, upper respiratory infection, wheezing, tonsillitisPostmarketing reports: Epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia[Ref]
Postmarketing reports: Palpitations[Ref]
Postmarketing reports: Enuresis in children[Ref]
