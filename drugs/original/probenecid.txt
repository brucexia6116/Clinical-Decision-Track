Applies to probenecid: oral tablet
In therapeutic doses, probenecid is generally well tolerated and has a low incidence of side effects.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria, pruritus[Ref]
Frequency not provided: Precipitation of acute gouty arthritis[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Uric acid stones with or without hematuria, costovertebral pain, urinary frequency[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Nephrotic syndrome, with or without renal failure[Ref]
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency may increase the risk of probenecid-induced hemolytic anemia in some patients.  However, probenecid has also been implicated in at least two cases of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.  In both cases, serum antibodies reacted with red blood cells only in the presence of probenecid.  In one patient, a generalized rash, fever, malaise, and anorexia were also present.[Ref]
Rarely (less than 0.1%): Aplastic anemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia Frequency not reported: Anemia, hemolytic anemia (which could be related to genetic deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) in red blood cells)[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, sore gums[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Hepatic necrosis[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Headache, dizziness[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Toxic epidermal necrolysis (in combination with colchicine) Frequency not reported: Dermatitis, alopecia, flushing[Ref]
