Weight gain of 7% or more was statistically significantly greater among patients with schizophrenia receiving ziprasidone in a pooled analysis of four 4 and 6 week placebo-controlled trials (10% versus 4%).  The median weight gain was 0.5 kg among all ziprasidone patients compared with no weight gain in the placebo patients.

Collective data gathered from 17 placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=5106) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death 1.6 to 1.7 times greater in the drug-treated patient than in the placebo-treated patient.  The average length of duration for the trials was 10 weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.  Although ziprasidone was not included in these studies, the consistent findings across all three relevant chemical classes support the opinion that these findings are likely to be applicable to all atypical antipsychotic agents.  Ziprasidone is not approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.

Ziprasidone is not indicated for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.In a study evaluating the QT prolonging effect of oral ziprasidone with other drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia, the mean increase in QTc from baseline ranged from 9 to 14 seconds which was greater than 4 of the comparator drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol) but was approximately 14 seconds less than thioridazine.
