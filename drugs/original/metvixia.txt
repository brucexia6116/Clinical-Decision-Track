In a cumulative irritancy and sensitization study, methyl aminolevulinate cream was applied three times each week for 3 weeks to separate sites on the back of healthy volunteers.  Following a 2-week interval without further applications, 30 out of 58 subjects (52%) who were rechallenged with the cream for 48 hours showed contact sensitization.The potential for sensitization was also assessed by patch testing in a total of 21 patients with actinic keratoses previously treated with methyl aminolevulinate cream on at least four occasions.  Methyl aminolevulinate cream and vehicle cream were applied to different sites on the lower back for 48 hours.  Three patients (14%) showed contact sensitization associated with erythema scores of 4 or higher (strong erythema spreading outside the patch), edema, vesiculation, papules, and glazing.
Postmarketing reports: Eczema, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria, .  Most cases were localized to the treatment area, but rarely, erythema and swelling have been more extensive.  Contact sensitization has been demonstrated in dermal safety studies.
Very common (10% or more): Eyelid edema (18%)Postmarketing reports: Edema, eyelid swelling, macular edema, vitreous detachment, keratitis
Very common (10% or more): Skin burning/pain/discomfort (86%; 20% severe), erythema (63%; 6% severe), scabbing/crusting/blister/erosions (29%; 2% severe), pruritus (22%), skin or eyelid edema (18%; 2% severe), skin exfoliation (14%; 3% severe)Common (1% to 10%): Skin warmth (4%), application site discharge (2%), skin hemorrhage (2%), skin tightness (2%), and skin hyperpigmentation (2%)Postmarketing reports: Angioedema
Treatment site reactions occurred in 113 out of 126 (90%) patients treated with methyl aminolevulinate cream in two clinical trials.  The most frequent adverse reactions were associated with phototoxicity at the treatment site.  Pain and burning sensation typically begin during illumination and resolve completely within a few minutes or hours, but may last up to a few days.  Erythema and other signs generally resolve within a few days to 3 weeks.
