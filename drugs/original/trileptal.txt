The most commonly observed side effects were dizziness, somnolence, diplopia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, abnormal vision, abdominal pain, tremor, dyspepsia, abnormal gait, headache, balance disorder, and asthenia.  In clinical trials in children aged 1 month to 4 years, the most commonly reported side effect was somnolence.  The side effects most commonly associated with discontinuation of oxcarbazepine (the active ingredient contained in Trileptal) included dizziness, vomiting, nausea, diplopia, and somnolence.[Ref]
The pattern of seizures following oxcarbazepine (the active ingredient contained in Trileptal) discontinuation suggests a rebound phenomenon rather than a loss of therapeutic efficacy.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Abnormal gait, ataxia, dizziness, headache, nystagmus, somnolence, tremorCommon (1% to 10%): Abnormal coordination, abnormal EEG, amnesia, ataxia, balance disorder, convulsions aggravated, cranial injury not otherwise specified, dysmetria, gait disturbance, hypoesthesia, impaired concentration, involuntary muscle contractions, speech disorder, taste perversionFrequency not reported: Aura, depressed level of consciousness, dystonia, extrapyramidal disorder, hemiplegia, hyperreflexia, hyperkinesia, hyporeflexia, hypokinesia, hypotonia, migraine, muscle hypertonia, neuralgia, oculogyric crisis, paralysis, syncope, tinnitus[Ref]

Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials of 11 different antiepileptic drugs lasting a median of 12 weeks showed that patients receiving antiepileptic drugs had approximately twice the risk of suicidal behavior or ideation (0.43%) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.22%).  The increased risk of suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation was observed as early as one week after starting the antiepileptic drug and continued through 24 weeks.[Ref]

The presence of the HLA-A*3101 allele may also increase the risk for drug rash with eosinophilia (DRESS), or less severe acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and maculopapular rash.Rare cases of angioedema have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of oxcarbazepine (the active ingredient contained in Trileptal) [Ref]

Other organs or symptoms that may be affected include the blood and lymphatic system (e.g., lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, leucopenia, splenomegaly), liver (e.g., abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis), muscles and joints (e.g., joint swelling, myalgia, arthralgia), nervous system (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy), kidney (e.g., proteinuria, interstitial nephritis, renal failure), and lungs (e.g., dyspnea, pulmonary edema, asthma, bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease).[Ref]
