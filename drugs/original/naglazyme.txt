During clinical trials, 53 out of 54 patients tested positive for antidrug IgG antibodies within 4 to 8 weeks of treatment.  In the placebo controlled study, 19 patients were evaluated for a potential relationship between development of antidrug antibodies to clinical outcome measures.  While all 19 patients developed antidrug antibodies, there was no consistent predictive relationship between total antibody titer, neutralizing or IgE antibodies, and infusion-associated reactions, urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels, or endurance measures.[Ref]
