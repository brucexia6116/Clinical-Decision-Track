The most frequently reported adverse reactions included hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as nausea diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, gastritis, abdominal pain, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and abdominal distention.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, dyspepsia, gastritis, abdominal pain, flatulence, gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal distension, decreased appetite, increased lipaseUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pancreatitis, including necrotizing pancreatitis[Ref]
Gastrointestinal adverse events occur more frequently at the beginning of therapy and generally diminish within a few days or weeks of continued use.  Nausea was transient for most patients.[Ref]
Weight gain may occur and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin.  After 26 weeks of insulin degludec / liraglutide 100/3.6, a mean increase of 2 kg occurred.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): HypoglycemiaCommon (1% to 10%): Decreased appetiteUncommon (0.1% to 1%): DehydrationFrequency not reported: Weight gain[Ref]
Liraglutide: Frequency not reported: Increased blood calcitonin, goitre[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Urticaria, rash, pruritus, face swellingRare (less than 0.1%): Hypersensitivity manifested with swelling of tongue and lips, diarrhea, nausea, tiredness, and itching Postmarketing reports: Anaphylactic reaction[Ref]
Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, pruritus, and/or swelling of the face have been reported following administration of this drug.  Few case of anaphylactic reaction with additional symptoms such as hypotension, palpitations, dyspnea, and edema has been reported postmarketing.[Ref]
Injection site reactions included injection site hematoma, pain, hemorrhage, erythema, nodules, swelling, discolorations, pruritus, warmth, and injection site mass.  These reactions are generally mild and transient, disappearing with continued treatment.  Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site.  Rotation of injection site may help reduce the risk of developing these reactions.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Injection site reactionFrequency not reported: Lipodystrophy[Ref]
Mean increase in heart rate of 2 to 3 beats per minute has been observed; long-term clinical effects are unknown.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increased heart rateFrequency not reported: Peripheral edema[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Rash, pruritus, urticaria[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Antibody formation[Ref]
Temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy may occur with abrupt improvement in glycemic control; however, long-term improvement may decrease the risk of progression.[Ref]
Insulin:Frequency not reported: Temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy, transitory reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder[Ref]
Pooled analysis of liraglutide clinical trials reveals the incidence rate for malignant neoplasms at 10.9, 6.3, and 7.2 per 1000 patient-years for liraglutide, placebo, and active comparator treated patients, respectively.  Incidence rates were based on investigator-reported events, medical history, pathology reports, and surgical reports from both blinded and open-label studies.  Seven cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma were in liraglutide-treated patients and 1 case in a comparator-treated patient.  Most were less than 1 cm in greatest diameter and diagnosed in surgical pathology specimens after thyroidectomy prompted by findings on protocol-specified screening with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound.  Seven malignant neoplasm events were reported beyond 1-year exposure to study medication: 4 colon, 1 prostate and 1 nasopharyngeal in liraglutide-treated patients with 1 (colon) reported in a comparator-treated patient.[Ref]
Liraglutide: Frequency not reported: Thyroid neoplasm, malignant neoplasms Postmarketing: Medullary thyroid carcinoma[Ref]
Liraglutide Frequency not reported: Renal impairment, acute renal failure[Ref]
Liraglutide: Common (1% to 10%): Elevated serum bilirubin, cholelithiasisUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Cholecystitis Postmarketing: Cholestasis, hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes[Ref]
Cholelithiasis and cholecystitis have been reported in liraglutide trials.  In doses of up to 3 mg, cholelithiasis and cholecystitis were reported in 1.5% (vs 0.5%) and 0.6% (vs 0.2%), respectively (compared to placebo).  The majority of patients with cholelithiasis and cholecystitis require cholecystectomy.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): HeadacheFrequency not reported: Acute painful peripheral neuropathy[Ref]
Acute painful peripheral neuropathy may occur with abrupt improvement in glycemic control; however, long-term improvement may decrease the risk of progression.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infection[Ref]
