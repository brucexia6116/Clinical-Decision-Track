Some nevirapine side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:


Applies to nevirapine: oral suspension, oral tablet, oral tablet extended release
Serious adverse effects can occur with nevirapine.  The most serious side effects have included hepatitis, hepatic failure, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions.  Hepatitis/hepatic failure may be isolated or associated with signs of hypersensitivity which may include severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, or renal dysfunction.The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which it is essential that patients be monitored intensively to detect potentially life-threatening hepatotoxicity or skin reactions.  Nevirapine should not be restarted following clinical hepatitis, or transaminase elevations combined with rash or other systemic symptoms, or following severe skin rash or hypersensitivity reactions.Side effects reported during postmarketing experience were associated with use of the immediate-release formulation.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Rash (including maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus)Common (1% to 10%): Moderate or severe rash (including rash, maculopapular rash, erythema nodosum, erythematous rash, papular rash, skin reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms; up to 7%)Frequency not reported: Severe and life-threatening skin reactions (including fatal cases), toxic epidermal necrolysis, allergic dermatitis[Ref]
The most common clinical toxicity was rash.  Rashes were usually mild to moderate, maculopapular erythematous cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, located on the face, trunk, and extremities.  Rash has occurred most often during the first 6 weeks of therapy.  Utilization of the 14-day lead-in period with immediate-release nevirapine has been shown to reduce the frequency of rash.During clinical trials, Grade 1 and 2 rashes were reported in 13% of patients taking immediate-release nevirapine during the first 6 weeks of therapy.  Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 2% of immediate-release nevirapine-treated patients.During one study, side effects of at least moderate intensity included rash (including rash, maculopapular rash, erythema nodosum, erythematous rash, papular rash, skin reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms) in 4% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 5% of patients using the extended-release formulation.Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported.  These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction.Women tended to be at greater risk of nevirapine-associated rash.Rash was reported in about half of patients with symptomatic hepatic side effects.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Elevated SGPT/ALT (up to 14%), symptomatic hepatic events (regardless of severity: up to 11%)Common (1% to 10%): Elevated SGOT/AST (up to 9%), asymptomatic transaminase elevations (AST or ALT greater than 5 times upper limit of normal [ULN]: up to 9%), clinical hepatitis (including hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, acute hepatitis, liver disorder, toxic hepatitis, hepatic failure, jaundice; up to 4%), elevated bilirubin (greater than 2.5 mg/dL: 2%), asymptomatic elevations in gamma-glutamyltransferaseFrequency not reported: Liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT), elevated alkaline phosphatase, severe and life-threatening hepatotoxicity (including fatal cases), progression to hepatic failure (with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia)Postmarketing reports: Jaundice, fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure[Ref]
Risk of symptomatic hepatic events (regardless of severity) was greatest in the first 6 weeks and continued to be greater in the nevirapine groups compared to controls through 18 weeks of therapy.Female gender and higher CD4+ cell counts at the start of therapy place patients at increased risk of hepatic events (including potentially fatal events).  Women with CD4+ cell counts greater than 250 cells/mm3 (including pregnant women using nevirapine with other antiretrovirals to treat HIV-1 infection) are at greatest risk.  However, nevirapine-associated hepatotoxicity can develop in both genders, all CD4+ cell counts, and at any time during therapy.  Coinfection with hepatitis B or C and/or increased transaminases at the start of nevirapine therapy are associated with a greater risk of later symptomatic events (6 weeks or more after starting nevirapine) and asymptomatic increases in AST or ALT.Rash was reported in about half of patients with symptomatic hepatic side effects.  Fever and influenza-like symptoms accompanied some hepatic events.Following the lead-in period, the incidence of any hepatic event was 9% with the immediate-release formulation and 6% with the extended-release formulation.  Symptomatic hepatic events (anorexia, jaundice, vomiting) were reported in 3% and 2% of patients using the immediate-release and extended-release formulations, respectively.  The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation was 8% with each formulation.During one study, side effects of at least moderate intensity included clinical hepatitis (including hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, acute hepatitis, liver disorder, toxic hepatitis, hepatic failure, jaundice) in 4% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 2% of patients using the extended-release formulation.In controlled studies, liver enzyme abnormalities (AST, ALT) occurred more frequently in patients receiving nevirapine.Elevated SGPT/ALT (greater than 250 units/L: up to 14%) has been reported with the immediate-release formulation.  Grade 2 elevated SGPT/ALT (2.6 to 5 times ULN) was reported in 13% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 10% of patients using the extended-release formulation.  Grade 3 elevated SGPT/ALT (5.1 to 10 times ULN) was reported in 3% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 4% of patients using the extended-release formulation.  Grade 4 elevated SGPT/ALT (greater than 10 times ULN) was reported in 4% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 2% of patients using the extended-release formulation.Elevated SGOT/AST (greater than 250 units/L: up to 8%) has been reported with the immediate-release formulation.  Grade 2 elevated SGOT/AST (2.6 to 5 times ULN) was reported in 9% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 7% of patients using the extended-release formulation.  Grade 3 elevated SGOT/AST (5.1 to 10 times ULN) was reported in 2% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 3% of patients using the extended-release formulation.  Grade 4 elevated SGOT/AST (greater than 10 times ULN) was reported in 2% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 2% of patients using the extended-release formulation.Severe, life-threatening, and in some cases fatal, hepatotoxicity (including fulminant and cholestatic hepatitis, hepatic necrosis, and hepatic failure) has been reported.  In some cases, patients presented with nonspecific prodromal signs or symptoms of hepatitis (including fatigue, malaise, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, liver tenderness or hepatomegaly, with or without initially abnormal transaminase levels).  Some events (particularly those with rash and other symptoms) progressed to hepatic failure with transaminase elevation, with or without hyperbilirubinemia, hepatic encephalopathy, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, or eosinophilia.  Patients without HIV using nevirapine for postexposure prophylaxis have reported serious hepatotoxicity, including hepatic failure.[Ref]
Grade 2 decreased neutrophils (750 to 999/mm3) was reported in 7% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 4% of patients using the extended-release formulation.  Grade 3 decreased neutrophils (500 to 749/mm3) was reported in 2% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 2% of patients using the extended-release formulation.  Grade 4 decreased neutrophils (less than 500/mm3) was reported in 1% of patients using the immediate-release formulation and 1% of patients using the extended-release formulation.[Ref]
