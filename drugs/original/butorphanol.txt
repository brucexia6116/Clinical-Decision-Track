Commonly reported side effects of butorphanol include: dizziness and drowsiness. Other side effects include: lethargy, cold and clammy skin, and diaphoresis.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The manufacturer has reported that in clinical trials (n=2,446), approximately half of the patients received butorphanol injection and the other half received butorphanol nasal spray.  The type and incidence of side effects with butorphanol by either route were consistent with those commonly found with opioid analgesics.
Nervous system effects including somnolence (43%), dizziness (19%), insomnia (11%), anxiety, confusion, euphoria, floating feeling, nervousness, paresthesia, and tremor have been reported.
Respiratory effects including nasal congestion (13%), bronchitis, cough, dyspnea, epistaxis, nasal irritation, pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinus congestion, sinusitis, and upper respiratory infection have all been predominantly reported from long term trials with butorphanol nasal spray.

Ear pain, tinnitus, and unpleasant taste have been predominantly reported from trials with butorphanol nasal spray.
Ocular effects including blurred vision have been reported.
Musculoskeletal effects including a case of fibrous myopathy have been reported in a patient abusing intramuscular butorphanol.
Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of butorphanol.
