In clinical trials of cobicistat / elvitegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide, increases in serum creatinine occurred by the second week of therapy and was stable through 96 weeks.  In therapy-naive patients, the change from baseline averaged 0.04 mg/dL (3.5 mcmol/L) after 96 weeks of therapy.
