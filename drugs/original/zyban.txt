In placebo-controlled clinical studies, the specific adverse events that led to discontinuation in at least 1% of patients treated with either 300 mg or 400 mg per day of Wellbutrin SR (R)included rash, nausea, agitation, and migraine.  Additional events leading to discontinuation in the immediate-release formulation included mental state abnormalities, vomiting, seizures, headaches, and sleep disturbances, many of which occurred at doses greater than the recommended daily dose.Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation with Zyban (R) included tremors, and rashes.  The most commonly observed adverse reactions were dry mouth and insomnia.  Smoking cessation is often associated with nicotine withdrawal symptoms, some of which are also recognized as adverse events associated with bupropion (the active ingredient contained in Zyban) [Ref]
The Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee reported that 285 of the 780 reports it received in association with bupropion (the active ingredient contained in Zyban) through mid-May 2001 involved psychological disturbances.Two cases of tactile hallucinations ("bugs crawling over skin") have been reported in association with bupropion extended-release (200 mg twice daily) therapy.  In both cases the symptoms abated following a reduction in the total daily dose of bupropion (300 mg daily).Insomnia may also be dose-dependent.  In a dose response clinical study for smoking cessation, 29% of patients receiving bupropion 150 mg/day versus 35% of those receiving 300 mg/day reported insomnia.  Insomnia may be minimized by reducing the dosage or avoiding administration at bedtime.[Ref]

The Australian Adverse Drug Reaction Advisory Committee reported that 268 of the 780 reports it received in association with bupropion (the active ingredient contained in Zyban) through mid-May 2001 involved nervous system disorders.Grand mal seizures have been reported in 0.4% of patients undergoing bupropion therapy at dosages up to 450 mg daily.  The incidence of seizures increases dramatically at higher dosages.  The seizure rate in patients taking sustained-release bupropion up to a dosage of 300 mg/day (e.g.  for smoking cessation) has been approximated at 0.1%.The risk of seizure appears to be dose-related.  Other risk factors are related to patient factors e.g., severe head injury, arteriovenous malformation, CNS tumor or CNS infection, or severe stroke, concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids), metabolic disorders, illicit drug use, abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants, diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemics or insulin, treatment with anorectic drugs, and excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.Two cases of elderly patients falling backwards have been attributed to the effects of bupropion on the basal ganglia.[Ref]

In clinical practice, hypertension, in some cases severe, requiring acute treatment, has been reported in patients receiving bupropion alone and in combination with nicotine replacement therapy.  These events have been observed in both patients with and without evidence of preexisting hypertension.Some investigators have suggested that bupropion therapy may be 10 to 100 times less likely to induce conduction problems than tricyclic antidepressants.[Ref]

One study in which 150 patients received the sustained released form of bupropion (the active ingredient contained in Zyban) reported the incidence of orgasm dysfunction at 8% in patients receiving a 300 mg daily dose and 10% in patients receiving a 400 mg daily dose.Among antidepressants, bupropion may be associated with the lowest incidence of sexual dysfunction (i.e., impotence, abnormal ejaculation, changes in libido).[Ref]
