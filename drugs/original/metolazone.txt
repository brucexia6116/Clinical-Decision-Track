A rare case of hyperosmolar nonketotic hyperglycemia is associated with metolazone.
Metabolic side effects are the most common and profound.  The rapid onset of hyponatremia or hypokalemia is often sudden and may be profound, particularly if metolazone is given with a loop diuretic.  Hypokalemia may be important in patients with underlying cardiac arrhythmias.  Metolazone may increase serum calcium and uric acid levels and lower serum magnesium and phosphate levels.  Glucose intolerance is reported in rare cases.
Cardiovascular side effects are uncommon.  Postural hypotension is reported in less than 5% of patients.  Rare cases of venous thrombosis are reported, thought to be due to metolazone-induced hypovolemia and increased serum concentrations of clotting factors.  Rare cardiovascular side effects also include palpitations, hypovolemia, and chest pain.
Renal insufficiency, manifest as a rise in serum creatinine and BUN, may occur, although, in most cases, creatinine clearance increases as a result of metolazone therapy.
Nervous system side effects include headache, dizziness, and fatigue.  Two cases of syncope and seizures are reported.  Metolazone-induced hypovolemia and electrolyte changes may induce hepatic encephalopathy in some patients.
It is not clear whether the patients who developed syncope and seizure activity were hypotensive or hypovolemic at the time of the seizures or that metolazone can definitively be implicated.  In one case the patient was also taking theophylline and had hypomagnesemia, which may be a complication of metolazone therapy.
Hypersensitivity reactions include rare case reports of necrotizing vasculitis, angiitis, and pruritic rashes.
A case of cutaneous hypersensitivity angiitis has been reported in a patient who had previously tolerated thiazide diuretics, indicating that, despite the chemical similarity between thiazides and metolazone, there is not necessarily cross-reactivity.
Hematologic abnormalities are rare.  Cases of reversible hypoplastic anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and mild leukopenia are reported.
Gastrointestinal side effects are rare, and include a case of acute pancreatitis.  Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and abdominal bloating are also rare.
Hepatic side effects include a rare case of cholestatic jaundice.
Musculoskeletal cramps are associated with metolazone therapy, as with other diuretics, and may be associated with electrolyte disorders and rapid intravascular volume shifts.
