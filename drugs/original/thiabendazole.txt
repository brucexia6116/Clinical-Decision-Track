Hepatic side effects reported have included liver damage.  It may manifest as jaundice, cholestasis, sicca syndrome, malaise, light-colored stools, and gastrointestinal upset.  These symptoms generally do not occur for several weeks following thiabendazole therapy completion.  Therapy usually consists of only supportive measures.
