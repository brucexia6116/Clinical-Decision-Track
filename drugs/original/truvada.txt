As well as its needed effects, emtricitabine / tenofovir may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking emtricitabine / tenofovir, check with your doctor immediately:
Some emtricitabine / tenofovir side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.

Side effects have been reported for emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) when taken in combination with other antiretroviral agents.  The most common side effects reported in HIV-1-infected patients during a clinical study of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir DF included diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, headache, dizziness, depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and rash.  In this trial, emtricitabine-tenofovir DF (with efavirenz) was used from weeks 96 to 144, replacing emtricitabine plus tenofovir DF (with efavirenz).In HIV-1-uninfected individuals in preexposure prophylaxis trials, the most common side effects reported with emtricitabine-tenofovir DF were headache, abdominal pain, and decreased weight.
