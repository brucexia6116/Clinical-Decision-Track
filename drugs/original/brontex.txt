Codeine: Frequency not reported: Respiratory depression
Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine in the postoperative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.  Further investigation has shown these patients to be ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.  Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine appear to be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.
