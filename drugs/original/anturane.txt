Gastrointestinal symptoms have been the most frequently reported side effects.  Peptic ulcer disease may be exacerbated or reactivated.[Ref]
Hematologic side effects including anemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and aplastic anemia have occurred.  Two cases of leukemia following chronic sulfinpyrazone (the active ingredient contained in Anturane) therapy have been reported.   Concomitant drug therapy was also reported and a causal relationship with sulfinpyrazone has not been established.[Ref]
Dermatologic side effects have been limited to rash.[Ref]
Renal failure has been reported.  Suggested mechanisms have included hypersensitivity induced interstitial nephritis, tubular-interstitial damage due to precipitation of urinary uric acid crystals, and inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.  Urolithiasis and renal colic may occur following initiation of therapy.  Adequate fluid intake and urinary alkalinization are recommended.[Ref]
Mobilization of urates during initiation of therapy has resulted in musculoskeletal symptoms of acute gouty arthritis.[Ref]
