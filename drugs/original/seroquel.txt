Common side effects of Seroquel include: asthenia, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, increased serum cholesterol, increased serum triglycerides, increased thyroid stimulating hormone level, and xerostomia. Other side effects include: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, increased serum alanine aminotransferase, orthostatic hypotension, pharyngitis, weight gain, and tachycardia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, quetiapine (the active ingredient contained in Seroquel) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking quetiapine, check with your doctor immediately:
Some quetiapine side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:

Collective data gathered from 17 placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=5106) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents, including quetiapine (the active ingredient contained in Seroquel)  for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death 1.6 to 1.7 times greater in the drug treated patient than in the placebo treated patient.  The average length of duration for the trials was 10 weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.  Similar results (i.e., increased risk of mortality with atypical antipsychotics) were reported in another meta-analysis involving elderly dementia patients that consisted of 15 randomized, placebo-controlled trials (n=3353) of 10 to 12 weeks in duration.  Quetiapine is not approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.An increased risk of mortality, possibly due to heart failure or sudden death, has been reported with the use of atypical antipsychotic agents in the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia.The results of a large retrospective cohort study appear to indicate that atypical antipsychotic agents (i.e., risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine) increase the risk of venous thromboembolism in elderly patients; however, these events seem to be rare.Blood pressure elevations described as systolic elevations of 20 mmHg or greater and diastolic elevations of 10 mmHg or greater were observed in 15.2% and 40.6% of children and adolescents, respectively.  One child with a history of hypertension experienced a hypertensive crisis.  QT intervals have not been systematically evaluated.  During clinical trials, persistent increases in QT intervals were not identified; however there have been postmarketing reports of QT prolongation in patients who overdosed on this drug, in patients with concomitant illness, and in patients taking drugs that are known to cause electrolyte imbalance or QT interval prolongation.
Very common (10% or more): Systolic (15.2%) and diastolic (40.6%) blood pressure elevations in pediatric patientsCommon (1% to 10%): Syncope, tachycardia, postural hypotension, peripheral edema, hypotension, hypertension, palpitationsUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Bundle branch block Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, AV bloc first degree, congestive heart failure, ST elevated, T wave flattening, ST abnormality, increased QRS duration, venous thromboembolism Very rare (less than 0.01%): Hypertensive crisis Frequency not reported: Cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, bradycardia, peripheral edemaPostmarketing reports: QT prolongation
Common (1% to 10%): Shifts in thyroid hormones and TSH, hyperprolactinemia, altered hormone levels, hypothyroidism Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): HypothyroidismRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Gynecomastia, hyperthyroidismFrequency not reported: PriapismPostmarketing reports: Syndrome of inappropriate hormone secretion (SIADH)
In adults, dose-related decreases in thyroid hormone levels have been observed.  It appears that maximal reductions in total and free thyroxine (T4) occur in the first 6 weeks of treatment and are maintained without adaptation or progression during chronic therapy.  Upon therapy discontinuation, these effects mostly return to baseline values.  The mechanism by which this drug affects the thyroid axis is unclear.
Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that include hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and weight gain.  While these effects have been shown as a class effect, each agent has its own profile.  Hyperglycemia: Adults: In controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks or less, 2.4% of patients with normal (less than 100 mg/dL) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) had at least 1 FPG reading of 126 mg/dL or greater (vs. placebo 1.4%) during treatment.  For patients with baseline borderline to high FPG (100 mg/dL or higher), 11.7% had at least 1 FPG reading of 126 mg/dL or greater (vs. placebo, 11.8%).  In 2 longer-term trials, the mean change in blood glucose from baseline in patients treated with quetiapine (the active ingredient contained in Seroquel) (mean exposure 213 days; n=646) was 5 mg/dL (vs. placebo -0.05 mg/dL).  Among patients with major depressive disorder receiving the extended-release formulation of this drug, a FBG greater than 126 mg/dL occurred in 7%, 12%, and 6% of those receiving 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo.  Pediatrics: In a study of patients 10 to 17 years old with bipolar mania, the mean change in fasting glucose was 3.62 mg/dL (n=170).  No patients with a baseline fasting glucose level lower than 126 mg/dL had a treatment-emergent blood glucose level greater than 126 mg/dL.  Dyslipidemia: Across indications, adult patients who experienced shifts in total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol from baseline to clinically significant levels occurred in up to 18%, 22%, 6%, and 14% of patients receiving this drug compared with up to 7%, 16%, 5%, and 14% receiving placebo, respectively.  For pediatric patients, the shifts were up to 12%, 22%, 8%, and 15% compared to up to 3%, 13%, 5%, and 19% for this drug and placebo, respectively.Weight gain: Logistic regression analysis has shown a positive dose response for weight gain.  Five to 10% of adult patients experienced a weight gain of 7% or greater (vs. up to 5% in placebo).  Among children and adolescents, a weight gain of 7% or greater occurred in 7% to 21% of patients receiving this drug compared with up to 7% in placebo patients.  Mean change in body weight was 1.7 to 2 kg in 3 to 6 week trials and 4.4 kg in 26 week trials.  These results were not adjusted for normal growth.
