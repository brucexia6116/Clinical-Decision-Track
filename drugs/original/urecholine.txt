As well as its needed effects, bethanechol (the active ingredient contained in Urecholine) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some bethanechol side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Adverse reactions occur more commonly following subcutaneous administration of bethanechol (the active ingredient contained in Urecholine) than with oral administration.Cholinergic overstimulation with symptoms of circulatory collapse, fall in blood pressure, abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, shock, or sudden cardiac arrest has been reported rarely with subcutaneous administration of bethanechol.  Atropine sulfate should be available to treat symptoms of toxicity when bethanechol is administered subcutaneously.  The adult dose of atropine is 0.6 mg administered subcutaneously every 2 hours, according to patient response.
Cardiovascular side effects have included decreased blood pressure with reflex tachycardia and vasomotor response.
Nervous system side effects have included headache and seizure.  Hypothermia has been reported.  An acute dystonic reaction associated with the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux during bethanechol (the active ingredient contained in Urecholine) therapy in an infant has been reported.
