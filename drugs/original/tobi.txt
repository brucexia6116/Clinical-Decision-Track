Applies to tobramycin: compounding powder, inhalation capsule, inhalation solution, injectable powder for injection, injectable solution, intravenous solution
Very common (10% or more):-TOBI(R): Headache (12%)-TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Headache (11.4%), hypoacusis (10%)Common (1% to 10%):-TOBI(R): Tinnitus (up to 3.1%)-TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Tinnitus (1.9%), deafness including unilateral deafness (reported as mild to moderate hearing loss or increased hearing loss; 1%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%):-TOBI(R): Deafness including unilateral deafness (reported as mild to moderate hearing loss or increased hearing loss; 0.5%)Rare (less than 0.1%):-Neuromuscular blockadeFrequency not reported:-Parenteral: Neurotoxicity, eighth-nerve impairment (auditory and vestibular ototoxicity), cochlear hair cell damage, dizziness, vertigo, roaring in ears, hearing loss, numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, convulsions, headache-Inhalation: Transient tinnitus, tinnitus, hearing loss, headache, ototoxicityPostmarketing reports:-Inhalation: Hearing loss, tinnitus, aphonia, dysgeusia[Ref]
Parenteral: Ototoxicity may have included loss of auditory or vestibular function secondary to cochlear hair cell damage.  Partial or total auditory changes were irreversible and usually bilateral; deafness may have continued to develop after drug was stopped.  Eighth-nerve impairment primarily occurred in patients with preexisting renal damage, with normal renal function treated for longer periods and/or at higher doses than recommended, who previously received an ototoxic agent, and who were dehydrated.  Risk of drug-induced hearing loss increased with extent of exposure to high peak or high trough serum levels.  Ototoxicity may be less likely when tobramycin serum trough levels are less than 2 mg/L after parenteral administration.Inhalation: Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity.  Some patients who concurrently received, or previously had prolonged therapy with, parenteral aminoglycosides reported hearing loss.Rare neurologic side effects have included neuromuscular blockade, particularly in patients who were predisposed, including patients with myasthenia gravis, hypocalcemia, and those receiving a neuromuscular blocking agent.Headache has been reported in patients using inhaled tobramycin with ciprofloxacin for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%):-Inhalation: Acute renal failureFrequency not reported:-Parenteral: Nephrotoxicity (usually reversible), renal function changes, rising BUN, rising non-protein nitrogen, rising serum creatinine, oliguria, cylindruria, increased proteinuria[Ref]
Nephrotoxicity primarily occurred in patients with preexisting renal damage and in patients with normal renal function treated for longer periods and/or at higher doses than recommended.  Predisposing factors also included advanced age, dehydration, and concomitant use of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.The overall incidence of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity was 2% to 10%, and increased if tobramycin trough levels exceeded 2 mg/L.  One study showed that hyperbilirubinemia in patients with biliary obstruction predisposed to aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.A 62-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, was started on inhaled tobramycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia.  The patient continued inhaled tobramycin for 27 days, during which her serum creatinine gradually rose.  After reaching a serum creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL, the inhaled tobramycin was discontinued on day 28 and the patient was started on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure.[Ref]

Decreased lung function included reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration.Bronchospasm has been reported with nebulized tobramycin in cystic fibrosis patients.  To help prevent bronchospasm, a bronchodilator should be used in conjunction with nebulized tobramycin.  The preserved parenteral formulation has been associated with more bronchospasm than the preservative-free solution for inhalation.Wheeze, cough, and dyspnea have been reported in patients using inhaled tobramycin with ciprofloxacin for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%):-Parenteral: Serious allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions), allergic-type reactions (including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes)-Hypersensitivity reactions (including eosinophilia, pruritus, fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis)Frequency not reported:-Cross-sensitivity among aminoglycosidesPostmarketing reports:-Inhalation: Hypersensitivity[Ref]
Severe and sometimes fatal allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported rarely.The sodium metabisulfite preservative in some formulations may cause allergic-type reactions (including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes) in some susceptible patients.[Ref]
Contact dermatitis in a patient using tobramycin-containing ear drops has been reported.A case of exfoliative dermatitis was associated with IV and intraperitoneal tobramycin (the active ingredient contained in Tobi) [Ref]

Toxic trough levels have been reported with nebulized tobramycin (the active ingredient contained in Tobi) administered by positive pressure ventilation to a patient with renal dysfunction.  No symptoms of toxicity were noted.Fatigue has been reported in patients using inhaled tobramycin with ciprofloxacin for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more):-TOBI(R): Pyrexia (12.4%)-TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Pyrexia (15.6%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%):-TOBI(R): MalaiseFrequency not reported:-Parenteral: Fever-Inhalation: Toxic trough levels, fatigue[Ref]
