In a clinical trial, safety of this drug was evaluated in therapy-naive patients using cobicistat-boosted atazanavir with emtricitabine-tenofovir.  The most commonly reported side effects were associated with elevated bilirubin levels including jaundice, ocular icterus, and nausea.  Study drug was discontinued due to side effects in 7% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group; 4.9% discontinued due to bilirubin-related side effects.[Ref]
In 1 clinical trial, hyperbilirubinemia (greater than 1 times the upper limit of normal [1 x ULN]) was reported in 97.7% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted atazanavir group and 97.4% in the ritonavir-boosted atazanavir group.  Increases in total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN was reported in 85.7% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and 77.7% in the ritonavir-boosted group.  Increases in total bilirubin greater than 2.5 x ULN was reported in 65% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and 56% in the ritonavir-boosted group.  Increased ALT or AST (greater than 3 x ULN) was reported in 12% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and 8.7% in the ritonavir-boosted group.  Increased ALT (greater than 5 x ULN), AST (greater than 5 x ULN), and GGT (greater than 5 x ULN) were reported in 3%, 3%, and 2% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group, respectively.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Hyperbilirubinemia, increased total bilirubin, jaundice (up to 13%), increased ALT or ASTCommon (1% to 10%): Increased ALT, increased AST, increased GGT[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Ocular icterus (up to 15%)[Ref]
Increased serum amylase (greater than 2 x ULN) was reported in up to 4% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group.If serum amylase was greater than 1.5 x ULN, lipase was also measured.  Increased lipase (grades 3 to 4) was reported in up to 9% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (up to 12%)Common (1% to 10%): Vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, abdominal distension, flatulence, dry mouth, increased lipase, increased serum amylaseFrequency not reported: Upper abdominal pain[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Increased creatine kinaseUncommon (0.1% to 1%): MyalgiaFrequency not reported: Rhabdomyolysis[Ref]
Increased creatine kinase (at least 10 x ULN) was reported in up to 6% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group.[Ref]
Increased urine RBC (greater than 75 RBC/high power field) and urine glucose (at least 1000 mg/dL) have been reported in up to 4% and 3% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group, respectively.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Hematuria (increased urine RBC), glycosuria (increased urine glucose)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Proteinuria[Ref]
Nephrolithiasis has been reported with atazanavir.  In clinical trials, nephrolithiasis was reported in 2% of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and no patients in the ritonavir-boosted group.  Onset of nephrolithiasis was about 24 weeks.Renal impairment (including acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome) has been reported when this drug was used in regimen containing tenofovir.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): NephrolithiasisFrequency not reported: Decreased estimated CrCl, increased serum creatinine, tubular secretion of creatinine inhibited (actual renal glomerular function not affected), renal impairment (including acute renal failure, Fanconi syndrome), nephropathy, Fanconi syndrome acquired[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Headache, dizziness, somnolence, dysgeusia[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Hyperglycemia, increased appetiteFrequency not reported: Increased fasted total cholesterol, increased fasted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased fasted low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased fasted triglycerides[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): FatigueUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pyrexia, asthenia[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Insomnia, abnormal dreamsUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Depression, sleep disorder[Ref]
