The most frequently reported adverse reactions have included lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, nausea, vomiting, and sweating.
Frequency not reported: Respiratory depression, respiratory arrest
Frequency not reported: Serotonin syndrome, hyperexcitability, convulsions, weakness, headache, tremor, involuntary muscle movements (e.g.  muscle twitches, myoclonus), delirium, dizziness, drowsiness, fainting, neurotoxicity, lightheadedness
Therapeutic doses of this drug have precipitated unpredictable, severe, and occasionally fatal reactions in patients who have received MAOIs within 14 days of receiving this drug.  The mechanism of this reaction is unclear, but may be related to preexisting hyperphenylalaninemia.  Reactions have included coma, severe respiratory depression, cyanosis, and hypotension.  IV hydrocortisone or prednisolone have been used to treat severe reactions, with IV chlorpromazine used in cases exhibiting hypertension and hyperpyrexia.  The usefulness and safety of narcotic antagonists is unknown.  Neurotoxicity associated with increased concentrations of active metabolite have occurred.  Reactions have included a range of excitatory effects including tremor, hallucinations, seizures, coma, and mood changes.
Frequency not reported: Mood changes (e.g.  euphoria, dysphoria), agitation, transient hallucinations and disorientation, confusion, dependence, anxiety, nervousness
Frequency not reported: Severe hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, shock, cardiac arrest, circulatory depression, flushing, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitations, hypotension, hypertension
Frequency not reported: Wheel and flare over the vein with IV injection, hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, histamine release leading to hypotension and/or tachycardia, sweating, flushing, and pruritus
Frequency not reported: Sensory-motor paralysis, phlebitis, injection site pain, local tissue irritation and induration following subcutaneous injection
Inadvertent injection about a nerve trunk may result in sensory-motor paralysis which is usually transitory.  Phlebitis has been reported following IV injection.
