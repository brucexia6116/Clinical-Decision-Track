As well as its needed effects, guaifenesin / hydrocodone may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some guaifenesin / hydrocodone side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
One study has suggested that the respiratory depression caused by hydrocodone may be of benefit in the treatment of dyspnea related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and restrictive lung disease.  However, the potential for the precipitation of respiratory insufficiency makes such use of hydrocodone hazardous and such use should be undertaken, if at all, only with extreme caution.
Nervous system side effects of guaifenesin have included dizziness and headache.  Central nervous system adverse effects of hydrocodone have included mental depression, dizziness, lightheadedness, respiratory depression (which is sometimes fatal), stupor, delirium, somnolence, agitation, and dysphoria.
Other side effects of hydrocodone have included withdrawal symptoms, such as agitation, restlessness, anxiety, insomnia, tremor, abdominal cramps, blurred vision, vomiting and sweating, after either abrupt cessation or fast tapering of narcotic analgesics.
Gastrointestinal side effects of guaifenesin have included upset stomach and vomiting with higher than recommended doses.  Doses recommended for expectoration are rarely associated with gastrointestinal upset.  Gastrointestinal side effects of hydrocodone have included nausea, vomiting, constipation, and dry mouth.
Genitourinary side effects of hydrocodone have included ureteral spasm, spasm of vesicle sphincters, and urinary retention.
Dermatologic side effects of guaifenesin have included rash. Narcotic-induced rash has also been reported.
