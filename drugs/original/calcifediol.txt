More frequently reported side effects include: increased serum calcium.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Metabolic side effects have included hypercalcemia, and increased phosphate absorption.
Early signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia include headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, constipation, abdominal cramps, dry mouth, weakness, fatigue, muscle and bone pain, ataxia, tinnitus, and vertigo.  Later hypercalcemia may result in pruritus, mental confusion, coma, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, metastatic calcification, and renal insufficiency manifested by polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia, and proteinuria.  Patients with renal failure are more prone to the development of hypercalcemia because the urinary excretion of calcium cannot compensate for increases in serum calcium.Increased phosphate absorption may be detrimental in patients with chronic renal failure and hyperphosphatemia.Because of the long half-life of calcifediol, reversal of toxic symptoms may take 7 to 30 days.
