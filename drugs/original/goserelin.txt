Pituitary apoplexy is a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland.  In a majority of the cases of pituitary apoplexy, a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed.  Most of the pituitary apoplexy cases occurred within two weeks of the first dose, and some occurred within the first hour.  In these cases, pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache, vomiting, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental status, and sometimes cardiovascular collapse.  Immediate medical attention has been required.[Ref]
Oncologic side effects including very rare cases of pituitary tumors have been reported.[Ref]
