Common side effects of Ciloxan include: corneal deposits. Other side effects include: eye discomfort.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking ciprofloxacin ophthalmic, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
The most common side effects were ocular discomfort, local burning/discomfort, dysgeusia, corneal deposits, and white crystalline precipitates.
White topical ocular precipitates have been observed in patients with corneal ulcer and frequent dosing of this drug which resolved after continued application of this drug.  Precipitate did not preclude continued use of this drug and did not adversely affect the clinical course of recovery.  Onset was within 1 to 7 days after starting therapy and resolution varied from immediately to 13 days after starting therapy.
Very common (10% or more): White crystalline precipitates (medication residue; up to 17%)Common (1% to 10%): Corneal deposits, ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia/erythema/redness, local burning/discomfort, eyelid margin crusting, crystals/scales, foreign body sensation, itching, conjunctival hyperemia, keratopathyUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Punctate keratitis, eyelid edema, lacrimation increased/tearing, photophobia, corneal infiltrates, decreased visual acuity/decreased vision, blurred vision, dry eye, eye pain, eye swelling, eye pruritus, eye discharge, eyelid exfoliation, conjunctival edema, erythema of eyelid/lid margin hyperemia, corneal staining, chemosis, eye inflammation, corneal toxicity, allergy, intolerance, heavy sensation, conjunctival reaction, eye hypoesthesia/numbing sensation, conjunctivitis, punctate epithelial erosion, progression of infiltrateRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Ocular toxicity, keratitis/keratoconjunctivitis, corneal disorder, corneal epithelium defect, diplopia, asthenopia, eye irritation, hordeolumFrequency not reported: Epitheliopathy
Common (1% to 10%): Dysgeusia/bad taste after instillationUncommon (0.1% to 1%): HeadacheRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Dizziness/lightheadedness

Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Hypersensitivity/allergic reactionsSystemic quinolones:-Frequency not reported: Hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions
Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions (some after first dose) have been reported with systemic quinolones.
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): DermatitisSystemic ciprofloxacin:-Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): PhototoxicityLocally-applied fluoroquinolones:-Very rare (less than 0.01%): Generalized rash, toxic epidermolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, urticaria
Moderate to severe phototoxicity has been reported in some patients exposed to direct sunlight while using oral ciprofloxacin.
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Ear pain, drug intolerance, abnormal laboratory test
Ruptures of the shoulder, hand, Achilles, or other tendons (requiring surgical repair or resulting in prolonged disability) have been reported with systemic fluoroquinolones.  Risk of such ruptures may be increased in patients using concomitant corticosteroids, especially geriatric patients and in tendons under high stress (including the Achilles tendon).
