Some people using this medicine have engaged in activity such as driving, eating, walking, making phone calls, or having sex and later having no memory of the activity.  If this happens to you, stop taking secobarbital (the active ingredient contained in Seconal) and talk with your doctor about another treatment for your sleep disorder.
Stop using secobarbital and call your doctor at once if you have:
unusual thoughts or behavior; 
new or worsening depression;
