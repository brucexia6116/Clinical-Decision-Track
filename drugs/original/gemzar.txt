More frequent side effects include: signs and symptoms of injection site.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Applies to gemcitabine: intravenous powder for solution, intravenous solution
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by gemcitabine (the active ingredient contained in Gemzar). In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking gemcitabine:
Some of the side effects that can occur with gemcitabine may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to gemcitabine: intravenous powder for injection, intravenous solution
Very common (10% or more): Anemia (68%), neutropenia (63%), leucopenia (62%), thrombocytopenia (24%), petechiae (16%), hemorrhage (17%), bone marrow suppression (usually mild to moderate)Common (1% to 10%): Febrile neutropeniaVery rare (less than 0.01%): ThrombocytosisPostmarketing reports: Capillary leak syndrome (CLS)[Ref]
Myelosuppression is the major dose-limiting factor associated with gemcitabine therapy.Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently necessary.  Less than 1% of patients have had to discontinue therapy for either anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia.  Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was more common in the elderly, especially older women.The risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura increases as the cumulative dose of gemcitabine approaches 20,000 mg/m2.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Nausea/vomiting (69%), diarrhea (19%), stomatitis (11%), stomatitis and ulceration of the mouth (11%)Common (1% to 10%): ConstipationVery rare (less than 0.01%): Ischemic colitis, anal pruritus[Ref]
If the patient is not vomiting due to their disease state, nausea can generally be prevented by administration of prochlorperazine or low-dose oral serotonin antagonists and glucocorticoid therapy.  One study of 790 patients found the rate of WHO grade 3 nausea and vomiting at a frequency of 22% in patients under 65 years of age, and 12% in patients 65 years of age or older.[Ref]
No evidence of increased hepatic toxicity has been reported with longer duration or greater total cumulative dose.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Increased ALT (68%), increased AST (67%), increased alkaline phosphatase (55%), hyperbilirubinemia (13%)Common (1% to 10%): Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure and death), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)Postmarketing reports: Hepatic veno-occlusive disease[Ref]
Renal failure may not be reversible, even upon discontinuation of therapy.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Proteinuria (45%), hematuria (35%), increased BUN (16%)Common (1% to 10%): Increased creatinine (8%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Renal failure, hemolytic-uremic syndrome[Ref]
The flu-like symptoms usually take place a few hours after drug administration.  The symptoms are usually self-limiting and recovery is generally within 24 to 48 hours.  Less than 1% of patients discontinued use due to flu-like symptoms.  Some patients get relief from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen.Out of the five reported cases of distal ischemic changes, four of those case related to combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine (the active ingredient contained in Gemzar)  while one case was of gemcitabine as a single agent in first-line therapy.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Fever (41%), asthenia, chillsCommon (1% to 10%): Paresthesia Rare (less than 0.1%): Radiation toxicity, radiation recallFrequency not reported: Cough, chills, pattern of tissue injury typically associated with radiation toxicity[Ref]
Rash was generally a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption, mild to moderate in severity, involving the trunk and extremities.  Alopecia is usually minimal.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Allergic skin rash frequently associated with pruritus (30%), alopecia (15%)Common (1% to 10%): Itching, sweatingRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Severe skin reactions (including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions), ulceration, vesicle and sore formation, scalingVery rare (less than 0.01%): Lyell's syndrome (toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson SyndromePostmarketing reports: Cellulitis[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Dyspnea (23%)Common (1% to 10%): Cough, rhinitisUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Interstitial pneumonitis, bronchospasmRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)Very rare (less than 0.01%): Respiratory failure/deathFrequency not reported: Pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema[Ref]
Some of the dyspnea reported may have been due to underlying disease.  Forty percent of the study population consisted of lung cancer patients, while some of the other study patients had pulmonary manifestations of other malignancies.Different patterns of lung injury may be related to gemcitabine.  A rapid response following the administration of corticosteroids would mean the respiratory problem was probably due to a hypersensitivity reaction.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Headache, insomnia, somnolence, paraesthesiaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Cerebrovascular accidentPostmarketing reports: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)[Ref]
Less than 1% of the paresthesias have been severe.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Injection site reactions (mainly mild)[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Hypersensibility[Ref]
Many of the patients that suffered cardiovascular effects had a prior history of cardiovascular disease.  Two percent of patients discontinued therapy due to these effects.  Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Arrhythmias (predominantly supraventricular), heart failureRare (less than 0.1%): Hypotension, hypertension, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillationVery rare (less than 0.01%): Congestive heart failurePostmarketing reports: Supraventricular arrhythmias[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Infection (16%), influenza-like symptomsRare (less than 0.1%): Anaphylactoid reactionFrequency not reported: Scleroderma-like reaction[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Edema/peripheral edema-including facial edema (usually reversible after stopping treatment)Common (1% to 10%): Anorexia[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Back pain, myalgia[Ref]
