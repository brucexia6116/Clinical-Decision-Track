Common side effects of Mirapex include: drowsiness, visual hallucination, constipation, and insomnia. Other side effects include: xerostomia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most common adverse reactions occurring in early Parkinson's disease when used without levodopa were somnolence, insomnia, nausea, constipation, dizziness, fatigue, asthenia, hallucinations, dry mouth, muscle spasms, and peripheral edema.  In advanced Parkinson's disease when used with levodopa, the more common adverse reactions included postural hypotension, dyskinesia, extrapyramidal syndrome, insomnia, abnormal dreams, confusion, asthenia, dystonia, somnolence, hypertonia, dry mouth, amnesia, urinary frequency, dizziness, nausea, constipation, hallucinations, headache, and anorexia.  The most common adverse reactions occurring in patients receiving treatment for Restless Legs Syndrome were nausea, somnolence, fatigue, and headache.
Early Parkinson's disease:Very common (10% or more): Somnolence (up to 36%), dizziness (up to 25%), dyskinesia (17%)Common (1% to 10%): Headache, hypesthesia, dystonia, myoclonus, akathisia, tremor, balance disorder, amnesia, abnormal thinking Frequency not reported: RestlessnessAdvanced Parkinson's disease: Very common (10% or more): Dyskinesia (up to 47%), extrapyramidal syndrome (28%), dizziness (up to 26%), Common (1% to 10%): Somnolence, dystonia, gait abnormalities, hypertonia, headacheRestless Legs Syndrome: Very common (10% or more): Augmentation (12%), headache (17%) Common (1% to 10%): Worsening of Restless Legs Syndrome, somnolence	Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Dyskinesia Postmarketing reports: Amnesia, hyperkinesia
In a 26-week clinical trial, worsening of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) occurred in 10% of patients suddenly withdrawn from pramipexole 0.75 mg once a day compared to 2% of placebo patients; the RLS symptoms were generally considered mild.  Augmentation was reported in 12% and 9% of patients receiving pramipexole 0.75 mg once a day and placebo, respectively.  The incidence of augmentation increased with increasing duration of exposure.
Parkinson's disease:Very common (10% or more): Hallucinations (17%), insomnia (27%), dream abnormalities (11%), confusion (10%)Common (1% to 10%): Paranoid reaction, delusions, confusion, sleep attacks, sleep disorder, depressionUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hypersexuality, pathological gambling, deliriumRare (less than 0.1%): ManiaFrequency not reported: Impulse control/compulsive behaviorsPostmarketing reports: New or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, binge eating, compulsive shopping Restless Legs Syndrome: Very common (10% or more): Insomnia (up to 13%)Common (1% to 10%): Abnormal dreamsUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hypersexuality, pathological gambling, deliriumRare (less than 0.1%): ManiaFrequency not reported: Impulse control/compulsive behaviorsPostmarketing reports: New or worsening mental status and behavioral changes, binge eating, compulsive shopping
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (28%), constipation (14%)Common (1% to 10%): Dysphagia, dry mouth, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, salivary hypersecretionUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hiccup Frequency not reported: HyperphagiaPostmarketing reports: Peritoneal fibrosis
Nausea and vomiting were commonly reported early in therapy and resolved with continued therapy.  While there have been postmarketing reports of fibrotic complications including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis, the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship with use of this drug; however a contribution of treatment cannot be completely ruled out.
Very common (10% or more): Postural hypotension (up to 53%)Common (1% to 10%): Chest pain, general edema Postmarketing reports: Cardia failure, syncope
Cardiovascular side effects have included orthostatic hypotension, with or without symptoms, although the overall incidence was not significantly different from that in placebo-treated patients.  In advanced Parkinson's disease trials, postural hypotension was reported in 53% (n=260) of patients receiving immediate-release pramipexole compared with 48% (n=264) of patients receiving placebo.  In fixed-dose trials in early Parkinson's disease, orthostatic hypotension was shown to be dose related with a frequency 2-fold greater than placebo for doses greater than 1.5 mg/day.  Among patients with advanced Parkinson's disease treated concomitantly with levodopa, orthostatic hypotension was reported much more frequently than in those with early disease and not receiving levodopa.In a pharmacoepidemiology study, pramipexole use was associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure compared with non-use (observed risk ratio: 1.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 2.85).
Common (1% to 10%): Urinary frequency, urinary tract infection, urinary incontinence, impotence
One case of rhabdomyolysis occurred in a 49- year old male patient with advanced Parkinson's disease receiving pramipexole (the active ingredient contained in Mirapex)   His creatinine phosphokinase level was elevated to 10,631 IU/L.  His symptoms resolved with discontinuation of the medication.
Common (1% to 10%): Arthritis, twitching, bursitis, myasthenia, extremity pain, back pain, muscle spasms, increased creatine phosphokinase Very rare (less than 0.01%): Rhabdomyolysis
Common (1% to 10%): Vision abnormalities, accommodation abnormalities, diplopia, Frequency not reported: Blurred vision
Common (1% to 10%): Skin disordersFrequency not reported: Pruritus
Common (1% to 10%): Dyspnea, rhinitis, pneumonia, nasal congestion, coughUncommon (0.1% to 1%): PneumoniaPostmarketing reports: Pleural fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis
There have been postmarketing reports of fibrotic complications including peritoneal fibrosis, pleural fibrosis, and pulmonary fibrosis, the evidence is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship with use of this drug; however a contribution of treatment cannot be completely ruled out.
