Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and pseudomembranous colitis.
Local side effects have included injection site pain and induration.  Vein irritation and phlebitis may occur when undiluted ticarcillin (the active ingredient contained in Ticar) is injected directly.
Hypersensitivity reactions have included skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, drug fever, and anaphylaxis.
Some studies show a positive correlation between the degree of hypokalemia, the dose of ticarcillin (the active ingredient contained in Ticar)  and the serum BUN/creatinine ratio, suggesting dehydration and higher doses are risk factors for the development of ticarcillin-associated hypokalemia.
Metabolic abnormalities have included hypernatremia and hypokalemia.
Hematologic side effects have included anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia.
Hepatic side effects have included elevations of SGOT and SGPT.
Nervous system side effects may include convulsion or neuromuscular excitability with high doses.
It is possible that some side effects of Ticar may not have been reported. These can be reported to the FDA here. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
