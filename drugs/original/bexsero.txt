Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction:  hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine.  When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects. 
You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.
Becoming infected with meningococcal disease and developing meningitis (infection of the spinal cord and lining of the brain) is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine. However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.
You may feel faint after receiving this vaccine.  Some people have had seizure-like reactions after receiving this vaccine.  Your doctor may want you to remain under observation during the first 15 minutes after the injection.
Common side effects may include:
headache;
feeling tired;
muscle or joint pain; 
chills;
nausea; or
pain, redness, or a hard lump where the shot was given.
This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report vaccine side effects to the US Department of Health and Human Services at 1 800 822 7967.
