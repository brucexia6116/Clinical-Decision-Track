Applies to atovaquone: oral suspension
In PCP prevention studies comparing atovaquone to inhaled pentamidine, 16% to 25% of patients discontinued atovaquone and 7% discontinued pentamidine due to adverse events.  Rash (6%), diarrhea (4%), and nausea (3%) were the most common reasons for discontinuing atovaquone, while bronchospasm (2%) was the most common reason for discontinuing pentamidine.  In studies comparing atovaquone to dapsone, treatment-limiting hypersensitivity reactions were more frequent in the dapsone group (16.1%) and treatment-limiting gastrointestinal side effects were more common in the atovaquone group (up to 4.1%).In PCP treatment studies, 9% of patients discontinued atovaquone due to side effects, compared to 24% of patients receiving sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.  The most common reason for discontinuation in both treatment groups was rash (atovaquone, 4%; sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, 8%).  In studies comparing intravenous pentamidine and atovaquone, 63% of patients in the atovaquone group and 72% of patients in the pentamidine group reported side effects.  Treatment was discontinued in 7% of the atovaquone patients and 41% of the pentamidine patients due to adverse events; the most common reasons were rash (4%) in the atovaquone group and hypoglycemia (11%) and vomiting (9%) in the pentamidine group.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects are among the most common and have included nausea (up to 40%), diarrhea (up to 42%), vomiting (up to 22%), abdominal pain (up to 21%), oral monilia (up to 10%), taste perversion (3%), and constipation (3%).  The incidence of side effects was higher in patients in PCP treatment studies than in prevention studies.  Seven percent of patients experience anorexia and 5% of patients experience dyspepsia, although these are difficult to attribute to the drug due to the serious underlying diseases in the patients who receive atovaquone.  Hyperamylasemia has been reported in 8% of patients.  Pancreatitis has also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Dermatologic side effects have included rash (up to 46%), pruritus (greater than or equal to 10%), exfoliative dermatitis, photosensitivity, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.  Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and skin desquamation have been reported during postmarketing experience in patients receiving multiple drug treatment including atovaquone.[Ref]
Hepatic side effects have included elevated ALT (greater than 5 times ULN, 6%), elevated AST (greater than 5 times ULN, 4%), elevated alkaline phosphatase (greater than 2.5 times ULN, up to 8%), and increased amylase (greater than 1.5 times ULN, up to 8%) in patients being treated for PCP.  Therapy was discontinued in 2% of patients receiving atovaquone due to ALT/AST elevations, compared to 7% of patients being treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.  Hepatomegaly has also been reported.  Rarely, hepatitis and at least one case of fatal liver failure have been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Hematologic side effects have included anemia (up to 6%) and neutropenia (up to 5%), but may be due to underlying disease.  Methemoglobinemia and thrombocytopenia have also been reported.[Ref]
Metabolic side effects have included hyponatremia (up to 10%), hyperglycemia (9%), and hypoglycemia (1%).[Ref]
Other side effects have included fever (up to 40%), asthenia (up to 31%), flu syndrome (greater than or equal to 10%), pain (greater than or equal to 10%), infection (up to 22%), sweating (greater than or equal to 10%), and malaise, but some may be due to underlying disease.  Fatigue, night sweats, and burning sensation of the tongue have also been reported.[Ref]
Respiratory side effects have included dyspnea (up to 21%), increased cough (up to 25%), rhinitis (up to 24%), sinusitis (greater than or equal to 10%), bronchospasm (up to 4%), and pneumonia.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects have included insomnia (up to 19%), dizziness (up to 8%), headache (up to 31%), anxiety (7%), and depression (greater than or equal to 10%).[Ref]
Musculoskeletal side effects have included myalgia (greater than or equal to 10%).[Ref]
Hypersensitivity reactions have included rash, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, and allergic reactions (unspecified, up to 1.1%).[Ref]
Renal side effects have included elevated creatinine (1%) and elevated BUN (1%).  Acute renal impairment has been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Cardiovascular side effects have included hypotension (1%).
Ocular side effects have included vortex keratopathy during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Immunologic side effects have included hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, bronchospasm, throat tightness, and urticaria during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
