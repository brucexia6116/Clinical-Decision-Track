Empagliflozin: The most frequently reported side effects included urinary tract infections and female genital mycotic infections.  Metformin: The most frequently reported side effects included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache.[Ref]
Empagliflozin is known to cause osmotic diuresis, leading to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion.  Adverse reactions related to volume depletion such as decreased ambulatory/systolic blood pressure, dehydration, hypotension, hypovolemia, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope were reported in 0.5% and 0.3% of patients receiving empagliflozin 10 mg (n=999) or 25 mg (n=977) orally once a day, respectively.[Ref]
Empagliflozin:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, decreased systolic blood pressure, decreased ambulatory blood pressure[Ref]
Empagliflozin-Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infectionsEmpagliflozin:Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infections, female genital mycotic infections, male genital mycotic infections, increased urination (e.g., polyuria, pollakiuria, and nocturia)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): DysuriaRare (less than 0.1%): PhimosisPostmarketing reports: Urosepsis, pyelonephritis[Ref]
During a 24 week study of empagliflozin in combination with metformin plus a sulfonylurea, urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported in 9.4% and 6.9% of patients receiving empagliflozin 10 mg (n=224) or 25 mg (n=217) once a day, respectively.  Pooled data from 5 studies showed the incidence of UTIs (e.g., UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and cystitis), was increased in empagliflozin-treated patients compared to placebo, more frequent in females compared to males, and more likely to occur in patients with a history of chronic or recurrent UTIs.  Treatment discontinuation due to UTIs occurred in 0.2% and 0.1% of patients receiving empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg once a day, respectively.[Ref]
The frequency of hypoglycemia depended on the type of background therapy used.  When empagliflozin was used as monotherapy, hypoglycemia was reported in 0.4% of patients taking the 10 mg and 25 mg doses.  In combination with metformin, hypoglycemia was reported in 1.8% taking 10 mg and 1.4% taking 25 mg.  In combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, hypoglycemia was reported in 16.1% taking the 10 mg dose and 11.5% taking the 25 mg dose.  In combination with basal insulin, hypoglycemia was reported in 19.5% taking the 10 mg dose and 28.4% taking the 25 mg dose.  Twenty reports of acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), ketoacidosis, or ketosis in patients treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors have been identified in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database during the period March 2013 through 06 June 2014.  All patients required emergency room treatment or hospitalization.  These cases were not typical of ketoacidosis or DKA in that they occurred in patients with type 2 diabetes and their blood sugar levels were only slightly increased.  Some factors identified as potentially triggering the acidosis included major illness, reduced food and fluid intake, and reduced insulin dose.[Ref]
