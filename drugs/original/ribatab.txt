As well as its needed effects, ribavirin (the active ingredient contained in RibaTab) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking ribavirin, check with your doctor immediately:
Some ribavirin side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
