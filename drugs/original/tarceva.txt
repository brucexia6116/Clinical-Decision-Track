These elevations were mostly transient or associated with liver metastases.A pharmacokinetic study in patients with advanced solid tumors and moderate hepatic impairment according to the Child-Pugh criteria has been reported.  In this study, 10 of the 15 patients died on treatment or within 30 days of the last dose.  Eight of these patients died from progressive disease, one patient died from hepatorenal syndrome, and one patient died from rapidly progressing liver failure.  Six out of the 10 patients who died had baseline total bilirubin greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal suggesting severe, rather than moderate, hepatic impairment.  All patients had hepatic impairment due to advanced cancer with liver involvement such as hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or liver metastases.[Ref]
