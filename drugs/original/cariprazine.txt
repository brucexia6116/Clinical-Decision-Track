The most frequently reported adverse effects were extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, dyspepsia, vomiting, somnolence, and restlessness.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Extrapyramidal symptoms (29%), akathisia (21%), headache (18%)Common (1% to 10%): Dizziness, somnolence, dystonia, ParkinsonismRare (less than 0.1%): Ischemic stroke[Ref]
During 6 week schizophrenia placebo controlled trials, 17% of patients reported extrapyramidal symptoms, excluding akathisia and restlessness in the cariprazine group.  This led to study discontinuation in 0.3% of patients.  Akathisia occurred in 11% of patients, leading to study discontinuation of 0.5%.  In 3 week bipolar mania placebo controlled trials, 28% of cariprazine treated patients experienced extrapyramidal symptoms, excluding akathisia and restlessness.  This led to study discontinuation in 1% of patients.  Akathisia occurred in 20% of patients, leading to study discontinuation of 2%.[Ref]
Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus: In long-term, open label studies in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, 4% of patients with normal baseline hemoglobin A1c developed elevated levels (HbA1c 6.5% or higher).  In short-term trials, the number of patients with shifts from normal fasting glucose (less than 100 mg/dL) to high (greater than 126 mg/dL) and borderline (100 to less than 126 mg/dL) levels were similar to placebo-treated patients.Dyslipidemia: In the 3 week placebo controlled bipolar mania and 6 week placebo controlled schizophrenia trials, the shifts in fasting total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides were similar in treatment and placebo groups.Weight gain: In the 6 week placebo controlled trial of patients with schizophrenia, a 7% weight increase or greater was observed in 8% of the patients receiving 1.5 mg to 3 mg of drug daily (n=512), 8% of patients receiving 4.5 mg to 6 mg daily (n=570), and 17% in the 9 mg to 12 mg once daily group (n=203).  During a long term, uncontrolled trial in patients with schizophrenia, the mean change from baseline weight at 48 weeks was 2.5 kg.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Decreased appetite, weight gain, increase in blood creatine phosphokinase, hyperglycemiaInfrequent: Hyponatremia, diabetes mellitusFrequency not reported: Dyslipidemia[Ref]
In 3 placebo controlled trials, during a three week period of treating bipolar mania (n=1065), there was no clinically significant difference between cariprazine and placebo treated patients regarding changes from baseline to endpoint supine blood pressure parameters.  There was however, an increase in supine diastolic blood pressure in the 9 to 12 mg orally once a day cariprazine treated patients.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Tachycardia, hypertensionUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Orthostatic hypotension[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): RashInfrequent: Hyperhidrosis[Ref]
Very Common (10% or more): Nausea (11%) Common (1% to 10%): Constipation, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, toothacheInfrequent: Gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastritisFrequency not reported: Dysphagia[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Insomnia (13%)Common (1% to 10%): Restlessness, agitation, anxietyRare (less than 0.1%): Completed suicideInfrequent: Suicide attempts, suicidal ideation[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis[Ref]
Transaminase elevations 3 times the upper limit of normal or greater occurred in 1% to 2% of patients in the cariprazine group during 6 week schizophrenia trials; the incidence increased with dose.  Elevations occurred in 2% to 4% of patients during 3 week bipolar mania trials.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increase in hepatic enzymesRare (less than 0.1%): Hepatitis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infectionInfrequent: Pollakiuria[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Rash, pruritus, urticaria, swollen lips/tongue, face and pharyngeal edema, swelling of the face[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Back pain, arthralgia, pain in extremities, stiffnessRare (less than 0.1%): Rhabdomyolysis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Cough, oropharyngeal painUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Nasopharyngitis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Blurred visionUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Cataracts[Ref]
In long term uncontrolled schizophrenia (48 week) and bipolar mania (16 week) trials, cataracts occurred in 0.1% and 0.2% of participants respectively.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Fatigue, pyrexia[Ref]
