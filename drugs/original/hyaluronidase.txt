Local reactions are the most common side effects.  The most common side effect during hypodermoclysis is edema.
Hyaluronidase increases the side effects of coadministered drugs.
Hypersensitivity reactions have included urticaria and angioedema in less than 0.1% of patients.  Anaphylactic-like reactions have rarely been reported after intravenous or retrobulbar injection.
One clinic has reported a possible increase in cases of angioedema related to the use of pharmacy-compounded hyaluronidase in cataract surgery as opposed to that seen with the use of manufactured products.
Ocular side effects have included case reports of hypersensitivity reactions after retrobulbar injections, which manifested as increased intraorbital pressure and swelling, periorbital edema, and localized pruritus.
