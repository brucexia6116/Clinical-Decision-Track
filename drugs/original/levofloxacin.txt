More frequently reported side effects include: diarrhea and insomnia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
WARNINGS: Levofloxacin may rarely cause tendon damage (such as tendinitis, tendon rupture) during or after treatment. Your risk for tendon problems is greater if you are over 60 years of age, if you are taking corticosteroids (such as prednisone), or if you have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant. Stop exercising, rest, and get medical help right away if you develop joint/muscle/tendon pain or swelling.
Levofloxacin should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis. It may cause the condition to become worse. Seek immediate medical attention if you develop muscle weakness or trouble breathing.
Other dosage forms:
The most frequently reported side effects with the IV and oral formulations included nausea, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation, and dizziness.  Therapy was discontinued due to side effects in 4.3% of patients overall (3.8% treated with 250 mg and 500 mg doses; 5.4% treated with 750 mg dose).  The most common side effects leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal (primarily nausea, vomiting), dizziness, and headache.Cough/productive cough, dysgeusia, and fatigue/asthenia were reported most often with the nebulizer solution formulation.
