Renal side effects have included dose-related nephrotoxicity, including BUN elevations (greater than 20 mg/dL) (36%), BUN elevations (greater than 30 mg/dL) (10%), depression of PSP excretion, abnormal urine sediment, renal insufficiency, and oliguria.

A patient with tuberculosis and portal cirrhosis experienced toxic nephritis and acute tubular necrosis coincident with capreomycin therapy.  The patient was treated with capreomycin therapy (1 g) and aminosalicylic acid daily for 1 month.  The patient developed renal insufficiency and oliguria and died.  The autopsy showed subsiding acute tubular necrosis.
