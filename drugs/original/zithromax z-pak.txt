Other dosage forms:
As well as its needed effects, azithromycin (the active ingredient contained in Zithromax) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking azithromycin, check with your doctor immediately:
Some azithromycin side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, and diarrhea in up to 10% of patients.  However, patients rarely (less than 1%) discontinued therapy due to these side effects.  Dyspepsia, flatulence, mucositis, oral moniliasis, constipation, melena, and gastritis have been reported with a frequency of 1% or less.  Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild to life-threatening.  Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of azithromycin (the active ingredient contained in Zithromax)   Anorexia, vomiting/diarrhea rarely resulting in dehydration, pancreatitis, oral candidiasis, pyloric stenosis, and rare cases of tongue discoloration have been reported during postmarketing experience.
Reappearance of allergic symptoms may occur without further azithromycin (the active ingredient contained in Zithromax) exposure when symptomatic therapy is discontinued.  This phenomenon may be related to the long tissue half-life of the drug.  Patients experiencing allergic symptoms may require prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment.
Hypersensitivity side effects have rarely included angioedema, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.  Toxic pustuloderma with fever has been reported in at least one patient receiving azithromycin.  There is also an isolated report of azithromycin-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.  Allergic reactions (including arthralgia, edema, urticaria, and angioedema) and anaphylaxis (rarely fatal) have been reported during postmarketing experience.
Cardiovascular side effects have rarely included arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia), prolongation of the QT interval, torsades de pointes, palpitations, hypotension, and chest pain in postmarketing experience.  A causal relationship has not been established.
Hepatic side effects have infrequently included transient elevations of liver function tests (including AST and ALT) and elevated bilirubin.  Hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice, as well as rare cases of hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure (some resulting in death), have been reported during postmarketing experience.
Local side effects associated with intravenous administration of the drug have included pain at injection site (6.5%) and local inflammation (3.1%).
Nervous system side effects have included headache, somnolence, vertigo, and dizziness in approximately 1% of patients.  Hearing disturbances including hearing loss, deafness, and/or tinnitus have been reported rarely.  Paresthesia, convulsions, hyperactivity, nervousness, agitation, and syncope have been reported during postmarketing experience.
Dermatologic side effects have included rash, pruritus, and urticaria.  Photosensitivity and, rarely, serious skin reactions (including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported during postmarketing experience.
Other side effects have included asthenia.  Taste/smell perversion and/or loss (rare), fatigue, and malaise have been reported during postmarketing experience.
Renal side effects have rarely included elevations in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen.  Interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure have been reported during postmarketing experience.  Interstitial nephritis resulting in permanent renal failure has been reported in a patient receiving azithromycin (the active ingredient contained in Zithromax) monotherapy.
Hematologic side effects have included decreased lymphocytes, increased eosinophils, leukopenia, and neutropenia.  Thrombocytopenia has been reported during postmarketing experience.
Metabolic side effects have included reduced bicarbonate and alterations in potassium.
Psychiatric side effects have included aggressive reaction and anxiety during postmarketing experience.
Genitourinary side effects have included vaginitis.  Moniliasis has been reported during postmarketing experience.
It is possible that some side effects of Zithromax may not have been reported. These can be reported to the FDA here. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
