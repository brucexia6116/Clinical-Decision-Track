Metabolic side effects, including lactic acidosis, which is a potentially fatal metabolic complication of biguanide therapy, has been reported in patients receiving metformin.  The incidence of lactic acidosis has been about 0.03 cases per 1,000 patient years with approximately 0.015 fatal cases per 1,000 patient-years.  The risk of lactic acidosis is particularly high in patients with underlying renal insufficiency.  Cases of lactic acidosis occurring in patients with normal renal function have been rarely reported.
