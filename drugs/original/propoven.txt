Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Anaphylaxis, in some cases with angioedema, bronchospasm, erythema, and hypotension (these reactions have been reported to respond to adrenaline)[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Pain during injection (burning, tingling/slinging)Very rare (less than 0.01%): Tissue necrosis following accidental extravascular administration[Ref]
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperlipidemia[Ref]
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Rhabdomyolysis (when administered at doses greater than 4 mg/kg/hour for ICU sedation)[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Paresthesia (up to 74%), excitation phenomena such as involuntary movements, twitches, tremors, hypertonus, hiccup Common (1% to 10%): Headache, shiveringRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Convulsions and seizures of the epileptic typeVery rare (less than 0.01%): Postoperative unconsciousnessFrequency not reported: Involuntary movements[Ref]
Paresthesias (including burning, tingling, stinging) and/or pruritus, usually manifested in the perineal region, were the most frequently recorded adverse reactions in clinical trials.  Paresthesias and pruritus generally occurred within 5 minutes after administration of the initial dose and were generally transient and mild to moderate in intensity.  The pharmacologic basis of these sensory phenomena is unknown.  No pretreatments, including the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, or lidocaine, are known to have an effect on or to reduce the incidence of these sensations.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Hypoxemia (up to 11%)Common (1% to 10%): Procedural pain (bronchoscopy), transient apnea, coughVery rare (less than 0.01%): Pulmonary edema, hiccough[Ref]
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Renal failure[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Thrombosis, phlebitis[Ref]
