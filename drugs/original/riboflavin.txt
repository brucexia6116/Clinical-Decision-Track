Along with its needed effects, a dietary supplement may cause some unwanted effects. Riboflavin may cause urine to have a more yellow color than normal, especially if large doses are taken. This is to be expected and is no cause for alarm. Usually, however, riboflavin does not cause any side effects. Check with your health care professional if you notice any other unusual effects while you are using it.
It is possible that some side effects of riboflavin may not have been reported. These can be reported to the FDA here. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
