Applies to pegloticase: intravenous solution
The most commonly reported adverse reactions included gout flares, infusion reactions, nausea, contusion or ecchymosis, nasopharyngitis, constipation, chest pain, anaphylaxis, and vomiting.
Common (1% to 10%): Anaphylaxis
The diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis included skin or mucosal tissue involvement, and either airway compromise, and/or reduced blood pressure with or without associated symptoms, and a temporal relationship with the injection as well as no other identifiable cause.  In clinical trials, 6.5% (n=8) patients receiving this drug every 2-weeks and 4.8% (n=6) of patients receiving this drug every 4 weeks experienced anaphylaxis.  All patients had been pretreated with oral antihistamine, IV corticosteroid, and/or acetaminophen.  There were no instances in placebo patients.
Infusion reactions occurred in 26% of patients receiving this drug every 2-weeks and 41% of patients receiving this drug every 4 weeks.  Manifestations have included urticaria, dyspnea, chest discomfort, chest pain, erythema, and pruritus.  These symptoms overlap with those that constitute anaphylaxis, but in the individual patient did not satisfy the clinical criteria for anaphylaxis.  Infusion reactions are thought to result from the release of various mediators, such as cytokines.  They may occur at any time during the course of treatment with approximately 3% occurring with the first infusion and 91% occurring during the time of infusion.  Some infusion reactions improved with the slowing of the infusion rate.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Infusion reactions (up to 26%)[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Anti-pegloticase antibodies (up to 92%)[Ref]
An increase in gout flares is frequently observed upon initiation of anti-hyperuricemic therapy due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting from mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.  During clinical trials, the frequency of gout flares was 74%, 81%, and 51% for patients receiving 8 mg every 2 weeks, 8 mg every 4 weeks, and placebo, respectively.  In the subsequent 3 months, the frequencies were 41%, 57%, and 67%, respectively.  Patients were receiving gout flare prophylaxis with colchicine and/or a NSAID.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Gout flares (77%)[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Chest painFrequency not reported: Congestive heart failure exacerbation[Ref]
During clinical trials, 2 cases of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation were reported among patients receiving 8 mg every 2 weeks.  During the open-label extension study while patients continued to receive 8 mg every 2 weeks, 4 patients reported CHF exacerbation.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (12%)Common (1% to 10%): Constipation, vomiting[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Nasopharyngitis[Ref]
Contusions were generally not reported on the day of infusion; most were thought to be related to other factors such as concomitant medications relevant to contusion or ecchymosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Contusion or ecchymosis (11%)[Ref]
