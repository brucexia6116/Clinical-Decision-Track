Chamomile is an herb also known as Camomille, Blue Chamomile, Camom√®le, Echte Kamille, Feldkamille, Fleur de Camomile, Kamillen, Kleine Kamille, Manzanilla, Matricaire, Matricaria chamomilla, Petite Camomille, Pin Heads, Sweet False Chamomile, and other names.
Chamomile is a common flavoring agent in foods and beverages, and other products such as mouthwash, soaps, and cosmetics. When used as a food product, chamomile is not likely to produce health benefits or side effects. When used as a medicinal product, chamomile may produce both desired and unwanted effects on the body.
Chamomile has been used in alternative medicine as a possibly effective aid in treating anxiety, upset stomach, colic (intestinal gas), or diarrhea. Chamomile may also be possibly effective in treating or preventing mouth ulcers caused by chemotherapy or radiation treatment. Chamomile may have been combined with other plants or extracts in a specific preparation to treat these conditions.
Chamomile has also been used to treat insomnia, gingivitis (gum disease), and skin irritation. However, research has shown that chamomile may not be effective in treating these conditions.
Other uses not proven with research have included hemorrhoids, vaginal infection, skin wounds, and common cold symptoms.
It is not certain whether chamomile is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. Chamomile should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.
Chamomile is often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.
Chamomile may also be used for purposes not listed in this product guide.
