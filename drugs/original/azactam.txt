Aztreonam (the active ingredient contained in Azactam) for inhalation:Very common (10% or more): Pyrexia (13%), pharyngolaryngeal pain (12%)Common (1% to 10%): Chest discomfort (8%), abdominal pain (7%)Aztreonam for injection:Common (1% to 10%): Superinfection (up to 10%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Weakness, fever, malaise, flushing[Ref]
Superinfection has been reported in up to 10% of patients during aztreonam therapy and was usually due to enterococcus or staphylococcus.[Ref]
Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment.[Ref]

Toxic epidermal necrolysis associated with aztreonam (the active ingredient contained in Azactam) has been reported in very ill patients on many other medications, making implication of aztreonam difficult.[Ref]
Aztreonam for inhalation:Common (1% to 10%): Rash (2%)Aztreonam for injection:Common (1% to 10%): Rash (1% to 1.3%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, purpura, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, urticaria, petechiae, pruritus, diaphoresis[Ref]

A 57-year-old male developed a widespread maculopapular eruption two hours after receiving aztreonam (the active ingredient contained in Azactam)   Corticosteroids and antihistamines were needed to control the reaction which disappeared after 8 days.  The patient also showed cross-reactivity to ceftazidime which shares the same side chain as aztreonam.[Ref]
Aztreonam for inhalation:Frequency not reported: Allergic reaction (with facial rash, facial swelling, throat tightness)Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasmRare (less than 0.1%): Maculopapular eruption (at least 1 case)[Ref]
A case of myelosuppression associated with aztreonam (the active ingredient contained in Azactam) has been reported, but because many other drugs were administered and because the patient was bacteremic, implication of aztreonam as the causative agent was difficult.In vitro studies have shown that aztreonam may inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation at high concentrations.  Clinically, therapeutic doses of aztreonam have not been associated with bleeding problems.[Ref]
Aztreonam for injection:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Less than 1%: Pancytopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, eosinophilia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosisFrequency not reported: Increased prothrombin time, increased partial thromboplastin time, positive Coombs' test[Ref]
