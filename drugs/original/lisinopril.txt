Commonly reported side effects of lisinopril include: dizziness, hypotension, hyperkalemia, increased blood urea nitrogen, and increased serum creatinine. Other side effects include: headache, and hyperkalemia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Hypotension is most likely in patients who are sodium and intravascular volume depleted.  In large studies, patients have reported "heart pounding" and chest pain, although the relationship to lisinopril is questionable.
