Transverse myelitis, bronchiolitis obliterans, aseptic meningitis, idiopathic hepatitis, sialadenitis, and sensorineural hearing loss have been reported rarely.  Postmarketing reports of serious infections have included necrotizing fasciitis and tuberculosis pneumonia.  Bacterial sepsis with seeding of distant sites, severe pneumonia with neutropenia, and worsening of infection (e.g.  cellulitis, pneumonia) despite antimicrobial treatment have also been reported.
