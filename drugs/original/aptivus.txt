In controlled clinical trials continued up to 96 weeks, 32.1% of patients developed grade 2 to 4 ALT and/or AST elevations.Grade 3 and 4 hepatic transaminase elevations were reported in 10.3% of therapy-experienced patients in 2 large studies and in 20.3% of therapy-naive patients in 1 study; the studies were through 48 weeks.  Elevated ALT or AST at baseline and hepatitis B or C coinfection were risk factors for such elevations in the 2 large studies; most patients were able to continue therapy with this drug (plus ritonavir).Clinical hepatitis and hepatic decompensation (including some fatalities) have been reported with this drug (plus ritonavir); generally in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications.Significant liver toxicity has been reported with this drug (plus ritonavir).  In at least 2 clinical trials, the frequency of transaminase elevations was significantly increased with this drug (plus ritonavir) compared to the comparator.[Ref]

Rash (including urticarial rash, maculopapular rash, and possible photosensitivity) has been reported in 8% of males and 10% of females using this drug (plus ritonavir) through 48 weeks of therapy.  The time to onset and duration of rash averaged 53 and 22 days, respectively.  Some cases of rash occurred in conjunction with joint pain or stiffness, throat tightness, and generalized pruritus.  Cases of rash (some severe) with myalgia, fever, erythema, desquamation, and mucosal erosions have been reported.  Rash has been reported more often in pediatric patients than in adults.[Ref]

In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted and some patients required additional factor VIII.  A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.[Ref]

Cases of fatal and nonfatal intracranial hemorrhage have been reported with this drug (plus ritonavir).  Many of the patients had other medical conditions or were using concomitant medications that may have contributed to or caused these events.  No pattern of abnormal hematologic or coagulation parameters was observed in patients in general or preceding development of intracranial hemorrhage.An increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage was previously observed in patients with advanced HIV disease/AIDS, such as those treated in clinical trials with this drug.[Ref]
