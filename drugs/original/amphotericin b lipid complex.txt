These symptoms usually begin 1 to 2 hours after the beginning of an amphotericin B lipid complex infusion, and are more common with the first few doses administered.Severe infusion-related side effects have been associated with conventional amphotericin B administration, and may be lessened by treatment with corticosteroids, acetaminophen, antihistamines, and meperidine.
Renal side effects have been reported less frequently with amphotericin B lipid complex than with conventional amphotericin B, and often included increased serum creatinine and BUN.  Renal failure occurred in about 5% of treated patients.  Decreased renal function, including oliguria, anuria, and renal tubular acidosis have also been reported.
Metabolic side effects have occurred less frequently with amphotericin B lipid complex than with conventional amphotericin B.  Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia often accompany amphotericin-induced nephrotoxicity.  Hypocalcemia has also been reported in treated patients.
Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in 5% to 8% of patients, have been associated with amphotericin B lipid complex infusions.  GI hemorrhage, abdominal pain, anorexia, dyspepsia, epigastric pain, cramping, malaise, and weight loss have occurred less frequently.
Hematologic side effects have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, and less frequently, coagulation defects, blood dyscrasias, and leukocytosis.
Nervous system side effects have been reported rarely, except for headache, which occurred in about 4% of treated patients.  Less frequently, convulsions, peripheral neuropathy visual impairment, including diplopia, hearing loss, tinnitus, and transient vertigo have been reported.
Hypersensitivity side effects have been reported.  These may present as bronchospasm, wheezing, or anaphylactoid reactions.  Erythema multiforme has also been reported.

Respiratory side effects including respiratory failure, dyspnea, pneumonia, or other respiratory disorders have been reported in treated patients.
Dermatologic side effects have included maculopapular rash, pruritus, and exfoliative dermatitis.  Exanthema has been reported in a patient who was treated concomitantly with amphotericin B lipid complex and imipenem-cilastatin.  The exact cause is unknown.
