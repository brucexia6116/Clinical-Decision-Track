Generic Name: simvastatin
More frequent side effects include: eczema and increased creatine phosphokinase.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Applies to simvastatin: oral suspension, oral tablet, oral tablet disintegrating
As well as its needed effects, simvastatin (the active ingredient contained in Zocor) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking simvastatin, check with your doctor immediately:
Some simvastatin side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:


Applies to simvastatin: oral tablet
Frequency not reported: Elevations in creatine kinase, myopathy, dermatomyositis, rhabdomyolysis, arthralgia, myalgia, tendon rupture, dermatomyositis, (exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is associated with a decreased risk of bone fractures in persons older than 50 years of age)[Ref]
Simvastatin has been associated with rare cases of severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.  This is accompanied by elevations in creatine kinase, myoglobinuria, and proteinuria, as well as renal failure.  Experience with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors indicates that concomitant use with gemfibrozil, nicotinic acid, cyclosporin, or erythromycin may increase the incidence and the severity of musculoskeletal side effects.Patients should be instructed to report symptoms of muscle pain, weakness, or tenderness.  If such symptoms develop, creatine kinase should be measured, and if elevated, simvastatin should be discontinued.  The value of regular monitoring of creatine kinase is not known.  In some studies, elevations in creatine kinase occurred in up to 5.2% of patients on simvastatin.  In most cases, these elevations were mild, transient, and not associated with clinical symptoms.[Ref]
Persistent elevations in liver function tests three times normal values are reported in up to 1.5% of patients on simvastatin (the active ingredient contained in Zocor) in clinical trials.  In one study, this led to the discontinuation of simvastatin in 0.6% of patients.  In other patients, elevations in liver function tests were transient and returned to normal with continued simvastatin therapy.  Liver function tests should be closely monitored.  Simvastatin should be discontinued in patients with persistent, significant elevations (3 times normal) in liver function parameters.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Elevations in liver function testsFrequency not reported: Hepatitis (including chronic active hepatitis), cholestatic jaundice, fatty changes in the liver, cirrhosis, hepatic failure, fulminant hepatic necrosis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Constipation, nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, dyspepsia, abdominal painVery rare (less than 0.01%): Protein-losing enteropathyFrequency not reported: Anorexia, pancreatitis, vomiting[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): HeadacheFrequency not reported: Cognitive impairment, cranial nerve dysfunction, tremor, vertigo, memory loss, paraesthesias, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve palsy[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Myoglobinuria, acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Angina[Ref]
The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) demonstrated a 30% reduction in total mortality in patients followed for a median of 5.4 years and a 42% decrease in death from coronary heart disease compared to placebo.  Simvastatin reduced the risk of major coronary events by 34%, hospital verified nonfatal myocardial infarction by 37%, and the need for coronary artery bypass graft or angioplasty by 37%, all significant compared to placebo.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Eczematous, pruritic rash, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, photosensitivity, purpura, alopecia[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Hypospermia, gynecomastia, thyroid function abnormalities, increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels.  Acid maltase deficiency (the genetic disorder also referred to as Pompe's Disease) has been revealed following simvastatin (the active ingredient contained in Zocor) therapy in at least one presymptomatic patient.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea[Ref]
Frequency not reported: A case of lupus-like syndrome which has been reported with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, positive ANA, ESR increase, polymyalgia rheumatica, and vasculitis[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Progression of cataracts, ophthalmoplegia[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Depression, suicidal thoughts, delusions, paranoia, agitation, decreased libido, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Erectile dysfunction, impotence, testicular pain[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Tumor growth, liver, thyroid, lung adenomas, carcinomas[Ref]
