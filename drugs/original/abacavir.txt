Applies to abacavir: oral solution, oral tablet
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by abacavir. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking abacavir:
Some of the side effects that can occur with abacavir may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to abacavir: oral solution, oral tablet
In 1 study, patients receiving the once-daily regimen had a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea than patients on the twice-daily regimen.Many of the side effects listed occurred commonly in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, lethargy, rash).[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Drug hypersensitivity, hypersensitivity reaction (including fever, rash [maculopapular, urticarial], nausea, vomiting, malaise, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, myalgia, achiness, abdominal pain, pharyngitis, dyspnea, cough, lethargy, myolysis, edema, elevated liver function tests, mucous membrane lesions [conjunctivitis, mouth ulceration], sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, anaphylaxis, paresthesia, lymphopenia, hepatitis, liver failure, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, renal failure, erythema multiforme, abnormal chest x-ray findings [mainly localized infiltrates], death)Frequency not reported: Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions, abacavir hypersensitivity reaction presenting as acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia[Ref]
Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with this drug.  Such reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and usually occurred within the first 6 weeks of therapy (median onset: 9 to 11 days); however, abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during therapy.Patients with the human leukocyte antigen subtype B*5701 (HLA-B*5701) allele are at higher risk of hypersensitivity reactions to this drug; however, such reactions have occurred in patients without the HLA-B*5701 allele.  Abacavir hypersensitivity was reported in about 8% of patients in 9 clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where patients were not screened for the HLA-B*5701 allele; incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions was 1% in clinical trials where HLA-B*5701 carriers were excluded.Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have been characterized by at least 2 of the following key signs/symptoms: (1) fever; (2) rash; (3) gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain); (4) constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, achiness); (5) respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, pharyngitis).  Almost all reactions have included fever and/or rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial); however, reactions also reported without fever or rash.  Signs/symptoms reported in at least 10% of patients with hypersensitivity reaction have included rash, nausea, vomiting, malaise, diarrhea, headache, fatigue/lethargy, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, elevated liver function tests, and myalgia.  Other signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity have included mouth ulceration, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, edema, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis, paresthesia, lymphopenia, hepatitis, liver failure, myolysis, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, renal failure, abnormal chest x-ray findings (mainly infiltrates, which were localized), and death.Symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction worsened with continued therapy and generally resolved when this drug was discontinued.  Restarting this drug after a hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in more severe symptoms within hours and included life-threatening hypotension and death.  Rarely, life-threatening reactions have occurred within hours after restarting this drug in patients who stopped it for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity (or who stopped it with only 1 key symptom of hypersensitivity).In 1 case report, a 57-year-old HIV-positive male presented to medical attention with a 2-day history of fever, malaise, and diarrhea related to initiation of this drug.  Six days prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient's antiretroviral therapy was switched from efavirenz and lamivudine-zidovudine to zidovudine, abacavir, and lopinavir-ritonavir after a drop in his CD4 cell count.  The patient developed acute dyspnea and severe hypoxemia, hemoptysis, and diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates within 72 hours of admission and this drug was discontinued due to suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction.  Three days after drug discontinuation, the patient's status improved and chest films showed resolution of infiltrates.[Ref]
Pancreatitis was observed in the expanded access program.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (up to 47%), nausea and vomiting (up to 38%), diarrhea (up to 16%)Common (1% to 10%): Abdominal pain/gastritis/gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and pain, abnormal amylaseRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Pancreatitis[Ref]

In 1 case report, a 31-year-old HIV-infected male patient switched to this drug and experienced a disulfiram-like reaction with nausea, facial flushing, and tachycardia after alcohol consumption.  When the patient was rechallenged with a shot of vodka, the same reaction occurred.In another case, a 27-year-old HIV-infected male patient switched to this drug and noticed reduced alcohol tolerance.  The patient reported that he felt as if he had ingested 1.5 bottles of wine after 3 glasses, with loss of memory until the next morning and vomiting.  The patient was able to tolerate small quantities of alcohol or alcohol consumed with food.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Headache (up to 31%)Common (1% to 10%): Headaches/migraine, dizziness, neuropathy[Ref]
