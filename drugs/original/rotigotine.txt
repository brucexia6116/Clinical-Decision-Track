Applies to rotigotine: transdermal film extended release
Very common (10% or more): Peripheral edema (up to 14%), orthostatic hypotension (up to 32%)Common (1% to 10%): Abnormal ECG T wave, first degree AV block, hypertension, palpitationsUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Atrial fibrillationRare (less than 0.1%): Supraventricular tachycardia[Ref]
The incidence of significant decreases in blood pressure or orthostatic hypotension increased during periods of dose escalation and titration.  In patients taking maximum recommended doses, orthostatic hypotension occurred (compared to placebo) at 29% (vs 11%), 27% (vs 23%), and 8% (vs 7%), in those with early stage Parkinson's disease (PD), advanced-stage PD, and restless legs syndrome, respectively.  The incidence of peripheral edema was 3% and 2% for patients with early-stage PD compared with 9% and 1% for patients with advanced-stage PD receiving drug and placebo, respectively.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (up to 41%), vomiting (up to 20%), Common (1% to 10%): Dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Abdominal pain[Ref]
Nausea and vomiting may occur at the beginning of therapy but these are usually mild or moderate in intensity and transient even if treatment is continued.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Somnolence (up to 32%), dizziness (up to 23%), dyskinesia (up to 14%), headache (up to 21%)Common (1% to 10%): Balance disorder, paresthesia, tremor, hypoesthesia, sleep attacksRare (less than 0.1%): Convulsion[Ref]
In clinical trials, 2% of patients receiving maximum doses of this drug for restless legs syndrome reported sleep attacks compared with 0% of patients receiving placebo.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Arthralgia (up to 11%)Common (1% to 10%): Muscle spasmsFrequency not reported: Elevated creatine phosphokinase[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Sinus congestion, nasal congestion, cough, nasopharyngitis, hiccups[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Visual disturbancesUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Blurred vision, visual impairment, photopsia[Ref]

Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hepatic enzyme increases (ALT, AST, GGT)[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Anorexia, increased weight, decreased weightFrequency not reported: Decreased serum glucose[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Elevated BUN[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Decreased serum ferritinFrequency not reported: Decreased hemoglobin/hematocrit[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Application site reactions (up to 46%), hyperhidrosis (up to 11%)Common (1% to 10%): Erythema, pruritus, Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Contact dermatitisRare (less than 0.1%): Generalized rash[Ref]
Application site reactions (ASRs) exhibited a dose-dependent relationship for all doses in patients with both Parkinson's disease and restless legs syndrome.  Reactions included localized erythema, edema, or pruritus, generally limited to the patch area; although generalized skin reactions such as allergic rash, including erythematous, macular-papular rash, or pruritus were reported at a lower incidence.  Rotation of application sites has been shown to reduce the incidence of ASRs.  When applied as instructed, 34.2% (n=748) of patients experienced ASR; the majority were mild or moderate in intensity.  Discontinuation occurred in 7.2% of patients[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep (up to 14%), hallucinations (up to 13%)Common (1% to 10%): Abnormal dreams, nightmare, irritability, sleep disorder, depression, impulse-control disorders Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Obsessive-compulsive disorder, disorientation, agitationRare (less than 0.1%): Aggressive behavior, binge eating, delusion, delirium[Ref]
Asthenic conditions included asthenia, malaise, and fatigue.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Fatigue (up to 18%), asthenic conditions (up to 14%)Common (1% to 10%): Tinnitus, vertigo[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Menstrual disorder, sexual desire disorder[Ref]
The most common adverse reactions experienced among patients with Parkinson's disease included nausea, vomiting, somnolence, application site reactions, dizziness, anorexia, disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, hyperhidrosis, visual disturbances, peripheral edema, and dyskinesia.  For patients with Restless Legs Syndrome, the most common adverse reactions included application site reactions, nausea, disturbances in initiating and maintaining sleep, somnolence, and headache.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Basal cell carcinoma[Ref]
