Applies to molindone: oral tablet
Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction:  hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
High doses or long-term use of molindone can cause a serious movement disorder that may not be reversible.  Symptoms of this disorder include uncontrollable muscle movements of your lips, tongue, eyes, face, arms, or legs.  The longer you take molindone, the more likely you are to develop a serious movement disorder.  The risk of this side effect is higher in women and older adults.
Stop using molindone and call your doctor at once if you have:
tremor (uncontrolled shaking);
trouble breathing or swallowing;
a seizure (convulsions);
restless muscle movements in your face or neck;
severe nervous system reaction--very stiff (rigid) muscles, high fever, sweating, confusion, fast or uneven heartbeats, tremors, feeling like you might pass out; or
low white blood cell counts--sudden weakness or ill feeling, fever, chills, sore throat, red or swollen gums, painful mouth sores, pain when swallowing, skin sores, cold or flu symptoms, cough.
Common side effects may include:
drowsiness;
fast heart rate, feeling restless or nevous, being unable to sit still;
blurred vision;
dry mouth;
little or no urination;
nausea, constipation; 
breast swelling or discharge;
impotence, sexual problems; or
changes in your menstrual periods.
