Generic Name: levofloxacin
More frequent side effects include: diarrhea and insomnia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
WARNINGS: Levaquin may rarely cause tendon damage (such as tendinitis, tendon rupture) during or after treatment. Your risk for tendon problems is greater if you are over 60 years of age, if you are taking corticosteroids (such as prednisone), or if you have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant. Stop exercising, rest, and get medical help right away if you develop joint/muscle/tendon pain or swelling.
Levaquin should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis. It may cause the condition to become worse. Seek immediate medical attention if you develop muscle weakness or trouble breathing.
Applies to levofloxacin: oral solution, oral syrup, oral tablet
Other dosage forms:
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by levofloxacin (the active ingredient contained in Levaquin). In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking levofloxacin:
Some of the side effects that can occur with levofloxacin may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:
