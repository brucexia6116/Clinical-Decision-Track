Gastrointestinal side effects have included sudden severe abdominal bloating, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and osmotic diarrhea.[Ref]
Metabolic side effects have included reports of hypernatremia.  These reports have primarily been associated with multiple administrations of activated charcoal sorbitol preparations.[Ref]
One case study describes a 37-year-old patient who presented with phencyclidine intoxication.  The patient was given four doses of activated charcoal in sorbitol and 1 dose of magnesium citrate over a 12-hour period of time.  Lab results showed an increase in the serum sodium from 138 mmol/L to 165 mmol/L.  The hypernatremia continued to worsen after the magnesium citrate was discontinued.  It was felt that the increase was due to the repeated sorbitol administration.  Other adult cases of hypernatremia secondary to activated charcoal-sorbitol regimens have been reported in the literature.[Ref]
