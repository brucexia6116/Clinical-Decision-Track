Side effects include:
Extrapyramidal reactions (e.g., pseudo-parkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia, akathisia, oculogyric crises, opisthotonos, hyperreflexia), drowsiness, lethargy, weight gain.       
The most commonly reported side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., pseudoparkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia).
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Blood dyscrasiasFrequency not reported: Transient leukopenia/leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, agranulocytosis/fatal agranulocytosis, cellular depression, eosinophilia, pancytopenia, aplastic/hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenic or nonthrombocytopenic purpura
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): Increased serum cholesterolFrequency not reported: Hyponatremia, loss of appetite, weight changes, blood glucose level alterations and loss of diabetic control
Rare (0.01% to 0.1%): JaundiceFrequency not reported: Cholestatic jaundice, hepatitis, increased cephalin flocculation and transient liver function test abnormalities (in the absence of jaundice)
Acute, distressing muscle spasms usually occurred within 24 hours of injection, and required immediate administration of an anticholinergic agent.
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Systemic lupus erythematosusFrequency not reported: Muscular rigidity, altered creatine phosphokinase, acute, distressing muscle spasms in the face, neck, eyes, tongue, and back
Very rare (less than 0.01%): Antinuclear antibodies
Frequency not reported: Opisthotonos, parkinsonism, pseudoparkinsonism/parkinsonian-like states, dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia, drowsiness, lethargy, headache, dystonia, acute dystonia/acute dystonic reactions, epileptiform attacks, altered consciousness, stupor, coma, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, autonomic instability, hyperreflexia, akinesia, electroencephalographic tracing alterations, alterations in cerebrospinal fluid proteins, cerebral edema, impairment in judgement and mental skills
Parkinsonism/parkinsonian-like states tended to occur 2 to 5 days after each injection, with a decreased frequency in subsequent injections.  This side effect may be reduced by using smaller, more frequent doses or adding an anti-parkinsonism agent temporarily.
Frequency not reported: Mild hypotension/hypotension, hypertension, arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, edema, peripheral edema, labile blood pressure, tachycardia, ECG changes, fatal cardiac arrest, QT and T-wave changes
ECG changes (including QT and T-wave changes) were dose-related side effects that usually occurred at moderate to high doses.  These changes may preclude serious arrhythmias.
Frequency not reported: Galactorrhea, abnormal lactation, oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, menstrual irregularities, impotence, priapism, inhibition of ejaculation (men), increased libido (women), impaired sexual function, bladder paralysis, polyuria, urinary hesitance and/or incontinency
Frequency not reported: Abnormal skin pigmentation, skin rashes, diaphoresis/perspiration, itching, erythema multiforme, contact sensitivity, urticaria, seborrhea, photosensitivity, eczema, exfoliative dermatitis, angioneurotic edema
Abnormal skin pigmentation occurred in patients receiving high doses for long durations of time.
Frequency not reported: Tongue protrusion, dry mouth, constipation, vomiting, nausea, gastric irritation, salivation, fecal impaction, paralytic ileus, difficulty swallowing, aspiration of gastric contents, hypertrophic papillae of the tongue
Lens opacities occurred in patients receiving high doses for long durations of time.
Frequency not reported: Oculogyric crises, blurred vision, lens opacities, glaucoma, mydriasis, corneal opacity, pigmentation of the eyes, pigmentary retinopathy, defective color vision, night blindness, deposition of particulate matter in the lens and cornea
Frequency not reported: Neonatal drug withdrawal syndromePostmarketing reports: Sudden, unexplained/unexpected deaths, body temperature dysregulation, hypothermia, hyperthermia
Sudden, unexplained/unexpected death occurred in hospitalized patients with psychosis.
Frequency not reported: Agitation, restlessness, excitement, insomnia, bizarre dreams, increased aggressiveness, reactivation/aggravation of psychotic processes, catatonic and confusional states
