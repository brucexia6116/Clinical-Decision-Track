Adverse reactions associated with insulin detemir (the active ingredient contained in Levemir) include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, and pruritus.[Ref]
Severe hypoglycemia defined as third party intervention, occurred in approximately 6% of patients receiving insulin detemir (the active ingredient contained in Levemir) in clinical trials.  Weight gain has been reported with insulin therapy and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): HypoglycemiaFrequency not reported: Weight gain[Ref]
Injection site reactions seem to occur more frequently with insulin detemir (the active ingredient contained in Levemir) than with human insulin products.  Reactions have included pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling, and itching at the injection site.  Most injection site reactions have been minor and transitory, disappearing in a few days to a few weeks, even with continued treatment.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Injection site reactionsUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Injection site pain[Ref]
Hypersensitivity side effects have included both local and systemic reactions.  Anaphylaxis has been reported.  Local reactions have presented as erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the injection site.  Most minor reactions to insulin at the injection site resolve in a few days to a few weeks.  Allergic reactions and potentially allergic reactions were reported more frequently in 3 clinical studies with subjects receiving combination oral antidiabetic agents compared with the frequency across all studies (2.2% versus 0.1% to 1%).[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Allergic reactions[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Peripheral edema[Ref]
Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, especially as metabolic control is improving.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy[Ref]
Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder and worsening of diabetic retinopathy.  However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): LipohypertrophyUncommon (0.1% to 1%): LipoatrophyPostmarketing reports: Rash urticaria[Ref]
In phase 3 trials, antibody development with no apparent impact on glycemic control was observed.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Influenza-like illness (up to 13%)Common (1% to 10%): Viral infectionFrequency not reported: Antibody development[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Pyrexia, fatigue[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Gastroenteritis (up to 16%), abdominal pain (up to 13%)	Common (1% to 10%): Nausea, vomiting, toothache[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infection[Ref]
Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible acute painful peripheral neuropathy.  However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Headache (up to 31%) Common (1% to 10%): Migraine, dizzinessRare (less than 0.1%): Painful peripheral neuropathy[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Upper respiratory tract infection (up to 35%), pharyngitis (up to 17%)Common (1% to 10%): Bronchitis, cough, rhinitis, sinusitis[Ref]
