Applies to efavirenz: oral capsule, oral tablet
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by efavirenz. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking efavirenz:
Some of the side effects that can occur with efavirenz may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away.

If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to efavirenz: oral capsule, oral tablet
The most significant side effects included nervous system symptoms, psychiatric symptoms, and rash.  The most common side effects (at least moderate severity) were impaired concentration, abnormal dreams, rash, dizziness, nausea, headache, fatigue, insomnia, and vomiting in patients using this drug in combination with lamivudine-zidovudine or indinavir.Administration of this drug with food may increase drug exposure and may increase the rate of side effects (especially nervous system symptoms).[Ref]
Increased nonfasting serum cholesterol and HDL have been reported; clinical significance unknown.Increased nonfasting triglycerides (at least 751 mg/dL) and glucose (greater than 250 mg/dL) have been reported in up to 11% and up to 5% of patients, respectively.[Ref]

In 19 such patients formerly on nevirapine, about half developed a mild to moderate rash; 2 of those patients discontinued therapy because of the rash.[Ref]

Psychiatric symptoms generally began the first or second day of therapy and often resolved after 2 to 4 weeks.  Patients with history of psychiatric disorders were at greater risk of serious psychiatric side effects.  Psychiatric side effects classified as serious during controlled trials included severe depression, suicidal ideation, nonfatal suicide attempts, aggressive behavior, paranoid reactions, and manic reactions.  One percent of patients discontinued or interrupted therapy due to at least 1 of these side effects.Side effects of moderate or severe intensity included insomnia (up to 7%), depression (up to 5%), anxiety (up to 4%), abnormal dreams (up to 3%), and nervousness (up to 2%).[Ref]
