Localized or diffuse myalgic or arthritic pain occurred, especially in psychoneurotic patients with insomnia.  This pain was most frequently located in the neck, shoulders, and upper limbs and appeared in paroxysms that were most intense early in the morning.  In some patients, pain continued for days after discontinuation of therapy.Decreased bone mineral density, Dupuytren's contracture, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures occurred in patients receiving long-term therapy; however, the exact mechanism of action in bones was not identified.[Ref]

Postmarketing reports: Abnormal hepatic function, hepatitis, liver damage, cholestasis, toxic hepatitis, jaundice[Ref]
Postmarketing reports: Hypocalcemia, folate deficiency, abnormal vitamin D metabolism, increased vitamin D requirements (possibly resulting from abnormal vitamin D metabolism), vitamin K deficiency, hypophosphatemia[Ref]
Postmarketing reports: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea[Ref]
Hypersensitivity reactions generally consisted of acquired hypersensitivity.  Patients with a higher risk of developing reactions were more likely to have asthma, urticaria, and angioedema.[Ref]
