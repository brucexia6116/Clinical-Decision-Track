In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by terbutaline (the active ingredient contained in Brethine). In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking terbutaline:

If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking terbutaline, get emergency help immediately:

Some of the side effects that can occur with terbutaline may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to terbutaline: compounding powder, inhalation aerosol, inhalation aerosol with adapter, injectable solution, oral tablet
Terbutaline has usually been well tolerated and adverse effects seen have been consistent with its pharmacological action.  In general, the severity of these adverse effects have been dependent on dose and the route of administration.  Administration by metered dose inhaler (MDI) has been associated with less systemic effects than administration of higher doses by nebulizer or orally.  Tolerance to the adverse effects of terbutaline (the active ingredient contained in Brethine) has occurred.[Ref]
Changes in heart rate of approximately 30% may be observed following 5 mg of terbutaline (the active ingredient contained in Brethine) given orally.  Aggravation of angina may be due to the tachycardia induced by terbutaline. Prolongation of the QT interval occurred in ten healthy males given a bolus injection of 0.25 mg terbutaline followed by an infusion of 5 mcg/min.  Supraventricular ectopic beats and ventricular tachycardia have also been reported.  Higher dosages of terbutaline should be used with caution in patients with cardiac disease, arrhythmias, or hypertension.  All of these effects are dose-related and lower doses may be tolerated.In one case-control study a positive association was found between the use of oral terbutaline for longer than 9 days and peripartum cardiomyopathy.  Further study is needed to determine if a causative relationship exists.[Ref]
Cardiovascular side effects have included palpitations and peripheral vasodilation, commonly resulting in reflex tachycardia.  Changes in blood pressure, both increases and decreases, have been reported.  Higher dosages have rarely aggravated angina and myocardial ischemia or caused atrial or ventricular arrhythmias.  Rarely, peripartum cardiomyopathy has been reported with oral therapy.  Pulmonary edema has occurred in pregnant patients receiving intravenous terbutaline.[Ref]
Musculoskeletal side effects have included tremors, especially at higher doses.  Tolerance has developed to the tremorogenic effects.  Severe muscle cramping has been rarely reported.[Ref]
Metabolic side effects have included hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and less commonly hyperglycemia.[Ref]
Infusions of terbutaline, 25 mcg/min, in women in premature labor has caused decreases in serum potassium of up to 1.6 to 2 mEq/L.  Another study in ten healthy males produced a mean decrease in serum potassium of 0.9 mEq/L following a bolus injection of 0.25 mg terbutaline, followed by an infusion of 5 mcg/min.  A decrease in magnesium of 0.08 mmol/L was produced in these same patients.This fall in potassium is presumably due to an intracellular shift of potassium secondary to hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects have included headache, restlessness, anxiety, nervousness, irritability, and insomnia.[Ref]
Other side effects have included the development of tachyphylaxis to the bronchodilating effects of terbutaline (the active ingredient contained in Brethine)   Although conflicting data exist, the development of complete tolerance has not been reported.[Ref]
