Cardiovascular side effects have included edema and congestive heart failure.[Ref]
Endocrine side effects have included the inhibition of estrogen synthesis, resulting in flushing, sweating, vaginal dryness and irritation, and reduction in breast size.  During administration of danazol (the active ingredient contained in Danocrine)  endogenous testosterone synthesis and release may be inhibited through feedback inhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH).  Large doses of danazol may suppress spermatogenesis through inhibition of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).  Danazol may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total T4 serum levels and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4.  Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea and vomiting.  Rare cases of pancreatitis have been reported.[Ref]
Genitourinary side effects have included oligospermia and decreased ejaculatory volume.  Elderly male patients may experience prostatic enlargement resulting in urinary obstruction.  Priapism and excessive stimulation may develop. In female patients, the use of danazol (the active ingredient contained in Danocrine) may result in virilization including deepening voice, hirsutism, acne, clitomegaly (rare), and menstrual abnormalities.  Discontinuation of medication at signs of mild virilization may prevent irreversible virilization.Alterations in libido may occur (increased/decreased).[Ref]
Hematologic side effects have included thromboembolic and thrombophlebotic events (including sagittal sinus thrombosis), some resulting in fatal strokes, and increased red cell production.[Ref]
Metabolic side effects have included significant increases in low density lipoproteins (LDL) and decreases in high density lipoproteins (HDL).  Decreased glucose tolerance requiring adjustments in hyperglycemic control has occurred.[Ref]
Other side effects in female patients have included virilization, including deepening voice, hirsutism, acne, clitomegaly (rare), and menstrual abnormalities, due the androgenic activity of danazol (the active ingredient contained in Danocrine)   Discontinuation of danazol at signs of mild virilization may prevent irreversible virilization.  Reduction in breast size may occur due to decreased estrogen synthesis.[Ref]
Renal side effects have included the retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, chloride, water and phosphorus, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium.[Ref]
Oncologic side effects have included rare cases of hepatic neoplasms following prolonged use.[Ref]
Hepatic side effects have included life-threatening peliosis hepatitis and benign hepatic adenoma following prolonged danazol (the active ingredient contained in Danocrine) administration.  Rare cases of hepatic neoplasms following prolonged use have been reported.  Danazol can exacerbate acute intermittent porphyria.  Serum transaminase levels may be increased.[Ref]
