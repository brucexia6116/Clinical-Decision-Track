Cardiovascular side effects have included elevations of heart rate and blood pressure.  In smaller doses, racepinephrine (the active ingredient contained in Asthmanefrin) has caused peripheral coronary arterial vasodilation, but in larger doses, racepinephrine has caused diffuse vasoconstriction.  This has caused increased peripheral vascular resistance, which was important in patients with coronary artery disease (worsened myocardial ischemia/angina) or hypertension (risk of emergent hypertension/stroke).Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in patients with underlying cardiac disease.  Rapid rises in blood pressure have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease.  Angina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea and vomiting.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects have included fear, agitation, anxiety, tenseness, restlessness, headache, tremor, dizziness, lightheadedness, nervousness, sleeplessness, excitability, weakness, and increased parkinsonian tremors.[Ref]
Psychiatric side effects have included agitation, disorientation, impaired memory, aggressive or assautive behavior, hallucinations, and psychosis.
