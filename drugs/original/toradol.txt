As well as its needed effects, ketorolac (the active ingredient contained in Toradol) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
If any of the following side effects occur while taking ketorolac, check with your doctor immediately:
Some ketorolac side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most common adverse reactions among patients treated with ketorolac (the active ingredient contained in Toradol) include abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia, and headaches.  For patients receiving the nasal spray, nasal discomfort, rhinalgia, increased lacrimation, throat irritation, and rhinitis were reported.
A large postmarketing observational study (n=10,000) revealed the incidence of clinically serious gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was dose dependent and more than double in patients 65 years or older.  The incidence of clinically serious GI bleeding after up to 5 days of treatment with doses of 60 mg or less, greater than 60 to 90 mg, greater than 90 to 120 mg, or greater than 120 mg, respectively was 0.4%, 0.4%, 0.9%, and 4.6% in those less than 65 years compared with 1.2%, 2.8%, 2.2%, and 7.7% in those 65 years or older.  Among patients with a history of GI perforation, ulcer, or bleeding, these numbers were 2.1%, 4.6%, 7.8%, and 15.4% compared with 4.7%, 3.7%, 2.8%, and 25%, in younger and older patients, respectively.
Very common (10% or more): Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nauseaCommon (1% to 10%): Constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, gastrointestinal (GI) fullness, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal), gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, stomatitis, vomiting, throat irritation (nasal spray) Frequency not reported: Anorexia, dry mouth, eructation, esophagitis, excessive thirst, gastritis, glossitis, hematemesis, melena, rectal bleeding, increased appetite, peptic ulcers, ulcers, hematemesis, gastritisPostmarketing reports: Acute pancreatitis, liver failure, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), eructation
Common (1% to 10%): Anemia, increased bleeding timeFrequency not reported: Bleeding, hematoma, postoperative wound hemorrhagePostmarketing reports: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia purpura, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, postoperative wound hemorrhage (rarely requiring blood transfusion)
Serious events of bleeding (n=4) or hematoma (n=3) at the operative site were reported in controlled clinical trials in patients (n=455) undergoing major surgeries (primarily knee and hip replacements, and abdominal hysterectomies) receiving ketorolac nasal spray compared with 1 patient in the placebo group (hematoma).In pediatric patients, an increased risk of bleeding was observed following tonsillectomy.  In a retrospective analysis, risk of bleeding following a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy was 10.1% in patients receiving this drug compared with 2.2% in those receiving opioids.  The postoperative hemorrhage rate in patients 12 years and younger was 6.5% with ketorolac treatment versus 3.3% without.  In a prospective study in patients 3 to 9 years undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy, the overall incidence of bleeding in patients receiving this drug was 16.3% compared with 17% in children receiving morphine.  However, during the first 24 hours after surgery, bleeding was observed in 14.3% of the ketorolac group versus 4.2% of the morphine group.
Common (1% to 10%): Edema, hypertension, bradycardiaFrequency not reported: Congestive heart failure, palpitations, pallor, tachycardia, syncope, cardiac failurePostmarketing reports: Arrhythmia, chest pain, flushing, hypotension, myocardial infarction, vasculitis
Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.  All NSAIDs appear to have a similar risk.  There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates this increased risk and may be associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal events.
