Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Aliskiren:Frequency not reported: Angioedema (face, hands, and body) with or without respiratory symptomsPostmarketing reports: AngioedemaHydrochlorothiazide:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Rash Rare (less than 0.1%): Anaphylaxis
Two cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with aliskiren use in clinical studies, and two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation.  The rate of angioedema cases in completed studies was 0.06%.  Twenty-six other cases of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body were reported with aliskiren use, including four which led to discontinuation.  In the placebo controlled studies, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands or whole body was 0.4% with aliskiren compared with 0.5% with placebo.
Frequency not reported: Edema, peripheral edemaAliskiren:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Elevated uric acid, gout, renal stonesPostmarketing reports: Peripheral edema, hyponatremiaHydrochlorothiazide:Very common (10% or more): Mild hypokalemia (decrease of 0.5 mEq/L) occurs in up to 50% of patients, and may predispose patients to cardiac arrhythmiasCommon (1% to 10%): Metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, elevated serum uric acid levelsVery rare (less than 0.01%): Hot flushesFrequency not reported: Edema, peripheral edema, glucose intolerance, a potentially deleterious effect on the lipid profile (i.e., increased serum cholesterol)
Aliskiren:Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux (these side effects appear to be dose related)Postmarketing reports: Nausea, vomitingHydrochlorothiazide:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
In women and the elderly (65 years of age or older) receiving aliskiren therapy, increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily.  Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation.
Aliskiren:Common (1% to 10%): RashRare (less than 0.1%): Angioedema (involving the face, hands, or whole body)Postmarketing reports: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis)Hydrochlorothiazide:Rare (less than 0.1%): Erythema annular centrifugum, acute eczematous dermatitis, morbilliform and leukocytoclastic vasculitis, phototoxic dermatitisFrequency not reported: Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus like reaction
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Malaise, painFrequency not reported: FatigueAliskiren:Frequency not reported: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousnessHydrochlorothiazide:Frequency not reported: Cerebrovascular insufficiency associated with hydrochlorothiazide-induced plasma volume contraction, cognitive and neurologic impairment (i.e., confusion, somnolence, feeling dazed)- Symptoms resolved following discontinuation of hydrochlorothiazide.
Episodes of tonic-clonic seizures were reported in two patients treated with aliskiren in the clinical trials.  One patient had predisposing causes for seizures and a negative electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral imaging following the seizures (the other patient's EEG and imaging results were not reported).  Aliskiren was discontinued and there was no rechallenge.
Common (1% to 10%): Occasional elevations (greater than 150% from baseline) in ALT (SGPT)Hydrochlorothiazide:Rare (less than 0.1%): Interstitial nephritis
Hydrochlorothiazide:Rare (less than 0.1%): Renal insufficiency, renal failure, renal dysfunction, interstitial nephritis
Hydrochlorothiazide:Rare (less than 0.1%): Immune-complex hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Asthenia, rigorsHydrochlorothiazide:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Myalgias, chills, muscle spasms, preservation of mineral bone density in older patients
Hydrochlorothiazide:Frequency not reported: Transient blurred vision, acute transient myopia, acute angle-closure glaucoma, xanthopsia
Aliskiren:Frequency not reported: Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, coughHydrochlorothiazide:Frequency not reported: Acute noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (these cases are thought to be due to idiosyncrasy or a hypersensitivity mechanism)
Rare (less than 0.1%): ParosmiaFrequency not reported: Tinnitus
Hydrochlorothiazide:Common (1% to 10%): Rash that is histologically identical to subacute cutaneous lupusFrequency not reported: Allergic vasculitis, hemolytic anemia
Aliskiren:Rare (less than 0.1%): HypotensionHydrochlorothiazide:Frequency not reported: Cardiac arrhythmias (including ventricular ectopy and complete AV heart block), hypotension, orthostatic hypotension (more common in the elderly)
