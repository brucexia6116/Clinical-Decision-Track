More frequently reported side effects include: tremor.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Applies to metaproterenol: inhalation aerosol liquid, inhalation aerosol powder, inhalation solution, oral syrup, oral tablet
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by metaproterenol. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking metaproterenol:

If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking metaproterenol, get emergency help immediately:

Some of the side effects that can occur with metaproterenol may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to metaproterenol: compounding powder, inhalation aerosol, inhalation aerosol with adapter, inhalation solution, oral syrup, oral tablet
Metaproterenol has been usually well-tolerated and adverse effects that occurred were consistent with its pharmacological activity.  Additionally, partial or complete tolerance may develop to these side effects.  In general, the severity of these effects are dependent on the dose and the route of administration.  Metaproterenol given by metered dose inhaler (MDI) is associated with less systemic effects than administration of higher dosages orally or by nebulizer.[Ref]
Cardiovascular side effects have included palpitations and peripheral vasodilation, commonly resulting in reflex tachycardia.  This may be caused by the interaction of metaproterenol with beta-1 and beta-2 receptors.  Blood pressure may increase or decrease.  Metaproterenol in higher dosages may rarely aggravate angina, myocardial ischemia, or cause atrial or ventricular arrhythmias.[Ref]
Musculoskeletal side effects have included tremors.  Tolerance often develop to the tremorogenic effects following prolonged use of this medication.  Severe muscle cramping may occur infrequently.[Ref]
The hypokalemic effect is due to the stimulation of beta-2 receptors that are linked to sodium-potassium ATPase in skeletal muscles, resulting in an intracellular influx of potassium.[Ref]
Metabolic side effects have included hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, and elevations in plasma insulin.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects have included restlessness, nervousness, anxiety, irritability, headache, dizziness, and insomnia.[Ref]
Other side effects have included the development of tachyphylaxis to the bronchodilating effects of metaproterenol.  Although conflicting data exist, complete clinical tolerance has not been observed.[Ref]
A 25-year-old woman respiratory therapist with a history of an itchy dermatitis on the face, neck, and upper extremities showed a positive reaction to metaproterenol on skin patch testing.[Ref]
Hypersensitivity side effects have included rare reports of dermatitis.[Ref]
Respiratory side effects have included pulmonary edema in pregnant patients receiving the drug intravenously.[Ref]
