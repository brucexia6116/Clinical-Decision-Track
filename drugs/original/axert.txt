At least 1 case of coronary vasospasm has been reported in a patient with no cardiac history and with documented absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) following administration of this drug.  During clinical trials (n=3865), a 48-year old female patient who had previously taken 3-doses for earlier migraine attacks was hospitalized after an ECG found negative T-waves on the left leads 48 hours after receiving almotriptan (the active ingredient contained in Axert) 6.25 mg.  Myocardial enzymes were normal.  The patient had a family history of CAD.  A coronary angiography and an ECG done 2 days later were normal.Mean increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed in normotensive healthy subjects (0.21 and 1.35 mmHg) and patients with hypertension controlled by medication (4.87 and 0.26 mmHg), respectively, over the first 4 hours after receiving almotriptan 12.5 mg.
