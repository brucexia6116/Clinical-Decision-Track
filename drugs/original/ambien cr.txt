In general, zolpidem (the active ingredient contained in Ambien CR) is well-tolerated and causes little or no residual daytime effects in most young adult volunteers.  Additionally, zolpidem does not significantly alter sleep architecture at recommended doses.General side effects including fatigue have been reported.
Nervous system side effects most frequently have included visual disturbances, ataxia, and dizziness.  Headache, drugged feeling, confusion, anterograde amnesia, excessive sedation, lightheadedness, delirium, nightmares, hallucinations, nervousness, and agitation have also been reported.
Chronic use in high doses and subsequent withdrawal may induce grand mal seizures.  Cases of falls have been reported in elderly patients.
Hypersensitivity side effects including rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue, glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative-hypnotics, including zolpidem (the active ingredient contained in Ambien CR)   Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea, throat closing, or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis.
Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department.  If angioedema involves the throat, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal.  Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, anorexia, and diarrhea.  In clinical studies on the sublingual tablet, one patient developed transient sublingual erythema and another patient developed transient paresthesia of the tongue.
Other side effects including tolerance to the pharmacologic effects of zolpidem (the active ingredient contained in Ambien CR) have been reported rarely.  Withdrawal symptoms after either abrupt cessation or fast tapering may occur.

Zolpidem-induced respiratory depression may be responsive to flumazenil.  Zolpidem-induced respiratory depression is generally not clinically significant at the usual hypnotic doses even in patients with impaired respiratory function.One study has suggested that zolpidem (the active ingredient contained in Ambien CR) doses of 20 mg (twice the usual dose) may cause apneic episodes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
Respiratory side effects have included respiratory depression which may occur at high doses.  Upper or lower respiratory tract infection and rhinitis have also been reported.
Cardiovascular side effects including palpitations have been reported in patients taking zolpidem (the active ingredient contained in Ambien CR)
