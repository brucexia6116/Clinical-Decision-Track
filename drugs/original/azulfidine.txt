Common side effects of Azulfidine include: gastric distress, headache, nausea, oligospermia, vomiting, and anorexia. Other side effects include: fever.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most common side effects reported were anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, gastric distress, elevated temperature, erythema, pruritus, rash, loss of appetite, and reversible oligospermia.  Less common side effects included urticaria, fever, Heinz body anemia, hemolytic anemia, and cyanosis.  Frequency of side effects increased with daily doses of 4 g or more, or total serum sulfapyridine levels above 50 mcg/mL.The use of enteric-coated preparations may decrease gastrointestinal side effects.

Angioedema was reported during postmarketing experience with the use of products containing or metabolized to mesalamine.The risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis increased largely with the use of sulfonamides; however, these phenomena were rare as a whole.
Very common (10% or more): Rash (up to 13%)Common (1% to 10%): Pruritus, urticariaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): AlopeciaFrequency not reported: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome), skin discoloration, erythema multiforme, parapsoriasis varioliformis acuta (Mucha-Haberman syndrome), generalized skin eruptions, petechiaePostmarketing reports: Angioedema, purpura, epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), toxic pustuloderma, erythema, exanthema, exfoliative dermatitis, periorbital edema, lichen planus, photosensitivity
Immunoglobulin suppression was slowly reversible and rarely accompanied by clinical findings.In most cases of sulfasalazine-induced SLE, patients received the drug for greater than 1 year.  Patients most commonly developed arthralgias and pleuritic chest pain.  Generally, these patients had a positive ANA, anti-DNA antibody titer, and were slow acetylators of sulfonamides.  Symptoms typically resolved over several weeks to several months.At least 1 case of Kawasaki-like syndrome with hepatic function changes was reported during postmarketing experience with the use of products containing or metabolized to mesalamine.
Very common (10% or more): Immunoglobulin suppression (10%)Frequency not reported: Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)Postmarketing reports: Kawasaki-like syndrome with hepatic function changes, induction of autoantibodies
Common (1% to 10%): Abnormal liver function testsUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Elevated liver enzymesFrequency not reported: Hepatic necrosisPostmarketing reports: Hepatotoxicity (some cases were fatal), including elevated liver function tests (SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, GGT, LDH, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), jaundice, cholestatic jaundice, cirrhosis, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, possible hepatocellular damage (including liver necrosis and liver failure); Kawasaki-like syndrome with hepatic function changes; fulminant hepatitis; hepatitis; hepatic failure
Hepatitis associated with sulfasalazine often developed 2 to 4 weeks after therapy was initiated, although hypersensitivity hepatitis has been reported after longer periods of therapy.  Associated rash usually progressed to desquamation.  Liver biopsy has shown necrosis and infiltration with moderate number of inflammatory cells.  Noncaseating granulomas have also been seen.  Hepatitis generally resolved over several weeks after therapy discontinuation, although some patients progressed to fulminant hepatic failure.Hepatitis has been reported in patients with sulfasalazine hypersensitivity.  Some of these cases were fatal.Side effects listed as postmarketing reports were reported during postmarketing experience with the use of products containing or metabolized to mesalamine.
Agranulocytosis has generally occurred during the first 1 to 3 months of therapy.  Patients often presented with fever and sore throat.  A few also presented with a rash.  Bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia was usually confined to the myeloid series, but may be accompanied by erythroid hypoplasia and marrow plasmacytosis.  In one review of 62 cases of sulfasalazine-induced agranulocytosis, 6.5% of patients died.  Recovery of granulocytes was generally seen within 1 to 2 weeks after drug discontinuation, and leukocyte counts and differential returned to normal in 1 to 3 weeks.  Some cases of agranulocytosis were treated with colony stimulating factor, which appeared to increase the time to recovery.
