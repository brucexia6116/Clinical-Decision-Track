Pivalate-containing compounds have been associated with clinically significant carnitine deficiency during prolonged use due to increased renal excretion of carnitine.  Short-term treatment with cefditoren has not been associated with clinical effects of decreased carnitine levels.  Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase.
Renal side effects have included increased BUN (less than 1%).  Acute renal failure has been reported during postmarketing experience.  Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with increased creatinine, renal dysfunction, and toxic nephropathy.
