More frequent side effects include: abnormal hepatic function tests.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, febuxostat (the active ingredient contained in Uloric) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention. 
Some febuxostat side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The more commonly reported side effects include liver function abnormalities, diarrhea, nausea, rash, headache, and edema.
Gout flares were commonly observed soon after the start of treatment and during the first months.  Thereafter, the frequency of gout flares decreased in a time-dependent manner.
Very common (10% or more): Gout flares (up to 43.1%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, decreased appetite, weight increase, blood triglycerides increase/hypertriglyceridemia, blood cholesterol increase/hypercholesterolemia, blood lactate dehydrogenase increase, blood potassium increaseRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Weight decrease, increased appetite, anorexia, blood glucose increase/hyperglycemiaFrequency not reported: Dehydration, hypokalemia, bicarbonate decrease, sodium increase, low density lipoprotein (LDL) increase
Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, nauseaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Abdominal pain/distention, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, dry mouth, dyspepsia, constipation, frequent stools, flatulence, gastrointestinal discomfort, blood amylase increaseRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Pancreatitis, mouth ulcerationFrequency not reported: Gastritis, gingival pain, hematemesis, hyperchlorhydria, hematochezia, peptic ulcer
Common (1% to 10%): Liver function abnormalitiesUncommon (0.1% to 1%): CholelithiasisRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Hepatitis, blood alkaline phosphatase increasePostmarketing reports: Jaundice, liver injury, cholecystitis, hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, hepatic failure (some fatal), serious cases of abnormal liver function tests, liver disorder
Liver function abnormalities occurred more frequently when given with colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis; abnormalities also occurred more frequently at 40 mg doses (8.3%) compared to 80 mg and placebo (6.4% and 2.2%, respectively).Alkaline phosphatase levels of at least 2 x the upper limit of normal (2 x ULN) most commonly occurred at 80 mg.  ALT increases of at least 3 x ULN most frequently occurred in patients given this drug at any dose compared to allopurinol and placebo.
Common (1% to 10%): HeadacheUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Dizziness, paresthesia, hemiparesis, somnolence, altered taste, hypoesthesia, hyposmiaFrequency not reported: Vertigo, gait disturbances, balance disorder, cerebrovascular accident, Guillain-Barre syndrome, lacunar infarction, lethargy, mental impairment, migraine, tremor, transient ischemic attack, EEG abnormal
Common (1% to 10%): RashUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Flushing, dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus/rash pruritic, skin discoloration/altered pigmentation, skin lesion, petechial, rash macular, rash papular, maculopapular rashRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Erythema, exfoliative rash, rash follicular, rash vesicular, rash pustular, rash erythematous, rash morbilliform, alopecia, hyperhidrosisFrequency not reported: Herpes zoster, dermographism, hair color change, hair growth abnormal, peeling skin, photosensitivity, skin odor abnormalPostmarketing reports: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, serious generalized rash
In clinical trials, no difference in side effects was observed between Asian patients and other ethnic groups; however, there have been postmarketing reports of serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions in some Asian patients.
Common (1% to 10%): EdemaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Atrial fibrillation, palpitations, ECG abnormal, hypertension, hot flush, chest pain/discomfort, left bundle branch block, sinus tachycardiaFrequency not reported: Major adverse cardiac events (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction/stroke), angina pectoris, atrial flutter, cardiac murmur, sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, hypotension
Edema occurred more frequently in patients given 80 mg (2.7%) than 40 mg (1.3%) or placebo (0.7%).In clinical trials, major adverse cardiac events occurred slightly more frequently in patients given 80 mg compared to 40 mg, allopurinol, or placebo.  Further investigation did not show an increased frequency of events between patients given 80 mg and allopurinol over time, though patients that developed events had a history of atherosclerotic disease, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure.  Gout has been associated with adverse cardiovascular events, and hyperuricemia was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
In postmarketing reports, rhabdomyolysis occurred more frequently in patients given concomitant treatment with a statin and colchicine; some patients had preexisting renal impairment/failure.
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, musculoskeletal pain, muscle weakness, muscle spasm, muscle tightness, bursitisRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Joint stiffness, musculoskeletal stiffness, rhabdomyolysisFrequency not reported: Joint swelling, muscle twitching/tightness, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increase
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Renal failure/insufficiency, nephrolithiasis, blood creatine increase, blood creatinine increase, blood urea increaseFrequency not reported: BUN/creatinine ratio increasePostmarketing reports: Tubulointerstitial nephritis
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Platelet count decrease, WBC decrease, lymphocyte count decrease, hemoglobin decrease, hematocrit decrease, hemorrhageRare (0.01% to 0.1%): Pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged, red blood cell count decreaseFrequency not reported: Anemia, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, leukocytosis, leukopenia, neutropenia, splenomegaly, purpura, mean corpuscular volume increase, neutrophil count decrease, WBC increase, coagulation test abnormal, prothrombin time prolonged
