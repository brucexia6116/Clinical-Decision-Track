Corticosteroids produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression.  Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if corticosteroids are withdrawn abruptly.  The risk of serious consequences of HPA axis suppression can be reduced by gradual dose reduction, however, in stress situations, reinstitution of steroid therapy may be necessary.  Additionally, a steroid "withdrawal syndrome" which is seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency may occur following abrupt discontinuance of steroids.  The steroid withdrawal syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss.
