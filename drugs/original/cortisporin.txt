Endocrine side effects of topical corticosteroids are rare.  Glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia may be induced by corticosteroids.  These drugs can rarely suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  This suppression is more likely when higher potency topical steroids are used over extensive areas and when occlusive dressings are used.[Ref]
