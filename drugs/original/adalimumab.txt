Commonly reported side effects of adalimumab include: upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection site reaction, skin rash, antibody development, sinusitis, and pain at injection site. Other side effects include: urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, and flu-like symptoms.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most serious adverse reactions have been serious infections, neurologic events, and malignancies.
Very common (10% or more): Accidental injury (10%) Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pain in extremity, thorax painRare (less than 0.1%): PyrexiaFrequency not reported: Sepsis, pain in thorax, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, abscess, joint infection, wound infection, superficial fungal infections
Most of the tuberculosis cases occurred within the first 8 months of therapy and included miliary, lymphatic, peritoneal, and pulmonary types.  Opportunistic infections were due to histoplasma, aspergillus, and nocardia.
Very common (10% or more): Headache (12%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Confusion, paresthesia, subdural hematoma, tremor, demyelinating disorders (e.g., optic neuritis, Guillain-Barre syndrome), cerebrovascular accident, multiple sclerosis, Very rare (less than 0.01%): Hypertrophic pachymeningitis
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Adenoma, Merkel Cell Carcinoma (neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin)Rare (less than 0.1%): Skin papilloma, carcinomas (breast, gastrointestinal, skin, testicular), lymphoma, melanoma, cancer of the white blood cells (known as Hepatosplenic T-Cell Lymphoma or HSTCL), mostly in adolescents and young adults
During the controlled portions of adalimumab trials in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, malignancies (other than lymphoma and non-melanoma skin cancer) were observed at a rate of 0.7 per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients versus a rate of 0.3 per 100 patient-years among control patients.  The median duration of treatment was 5.7 months for adalimumab-treated patients and 5.5 months for control-treated patients.  During the controlled portions of adalimumab rheumatoid arthritis trials, the rate of non-melanoma skin cancers was 0.9 per 100 patient-years among adalimumab-treated patients and 0.2 per 100 patient-years among control patients.More cases of malignancies have been observed among patients receiving TNF blockers, including adalimumab, compared to controls.  Patients with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those with highly active disease, are at a higher risk for the development of lymphoma.A meta-analysis has reported that there is dose-dependent increased risk of malignancies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-TNF antibody therapy.
Positive ANA titers were observed at week 24 in 12% of patients (vs 7% with placebo).  One patient (0.04%) developed symptoms of new-onset lupus-like syndrome and recovered after discontinuation of adalimumab.  Low-titer antibodies to adalimumab have been observed at least once during treatment in 5% of patients (n=1062).  Antibodies developed in 12% of patients on adalimumab monotherapy and in 1% of patients on concurrent methotrexate.  During monotherapy, the ACR20 (American College of Rheumatology criteria) response was lower in antibody-positive patients.A meta-analysis has reported that there is evidence of an increased risk of serious infections in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-TNF antibody therapy.
