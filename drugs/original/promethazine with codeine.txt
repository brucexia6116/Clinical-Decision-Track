Concomitant administration of promethazine with other respiratory depressants has been associated with respiratory depression, including fatalities.  Postmarketing cases in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age has been reported with a wide range of weight-based doses.  Respiratory depression has been associated with antitussive use of codeine in young children.

Further investigation has shown these patients to be ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.  Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine appear to be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.[Ref]
