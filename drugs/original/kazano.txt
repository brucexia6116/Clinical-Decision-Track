Common side effects of Kazano include: lactic acidosis, nausea, vomiting, and hypoglycemia. Other side effects include: upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal distress, headache, and nasopharyngitis.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most common adverse reactions reported include upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, hypertension, headache, back pain, and urinary tract infection.
Alogliptin-Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, vomiting, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease Alogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pancreatitis Postmarketing reports: Acute pancreatitisMetformin:Very common (10% or more): Diarrhea (up to 53.2%), Nausea/vomiting (25.5%), flatulence (12.1%)Common (1% to 10%): Indigestion, abdominal discomfort
Acute pancreatitis has been associated with DPP-4 inhibitors.  In a pooled analysis of 13 studies, the overall rate of pancreatitis reported with alogliptin 25 mg, 12.5 mg, active control, or placebo was 2, 1, 1, or 0, events per 1000 patient years, respectively.
Alogliptin:Postmarketing reports: Hepatic enzyme elevations, fulminant hepatic failureMetformin:Very rare (less than 0.01%): Hepatitis, liver function test abnormalities
Cases of hepatic dysfunction including hepatic failure have been received in the postmarketing period with alogliptin-treated patients; causality has not been established.
Alogliptin-Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): HypoglycemiaAlogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Hypoglycemia Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Hypoglycemia, loss of appetiteVery rare (less than 0.01%): Lactic acidosis, vitamin B12 deficiency
In metformin-treated patients, lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 0.03 cases per 1000 patient-years with approximately half these cases resulting in fatalities.  In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure in clinical trials, there were no cases of lactic acidosis.  Reported cases have occurred primarily in patients with significant renal insufficiency, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications.  In an alogliptin monotherapy study, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 1.5% (compared with 1.6% in placebo).  Adding alogliptin to glyburide or insulin did not increase the incidence of hypoglycemia compared with placebo.  In elderly patients, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 5.4% with alogliptin compared with 26% for glipizide.  In a 26-week, placebo-controlled study of alogliptin once daily as add-on to a metformin regimen, hypoglycemic events were reported in 0.9% of patients in the alogliptin-metformin group compared with 2.9% in the placebo group.
Alogliptin:Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hypersensitivity reactions (0.6%)Postmarketing reports: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme
Postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors use.  These case typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of DPP-4 inhibitor.
Alogliptin-metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Pruritus, rashAlogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Pruritus, rashPostmarketing reports: Exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, angioedema, urticariaMetformin:Very rare (less than 0.01%): Erythema, pruritus, urticariaDipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors:Postmarketing reports: Bullous pemphigoid
Alogliptin-Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis Alogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis
Alogliptin-Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Headache Alogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Headache Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Headache, metallic taste
Alogliptin-Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Hypertension Alogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Hypertension Frequency not reported: Heart failureMetformin:Common (1% to 10%): Hypertension
In a clinical trial in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome, a greater proportion of patients receiving this drug were hospitalized for congestive heart failure compared with placebo (3.9% [n=106] vs 3.3% [n=89]),
Alogliptin-Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infection Alogliptin:Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infection Metformin:Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infection
Between October 2006 and December 2013, thirty-three cases of severe arthralgia have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Database.  Each case involved the use of 1 or more dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor.  In all cases, substantial reduction in prior activity level was reported, 10 patients were hospitalized due to disabling joint pain.  In 22 cases, symptoms appeared within 1 month of starting therapy, in 23 cases symptoms resolved less than 1 month after discontinuation.  A positive rechallenge was reported in 8 cases, with 6 cases involving use of a different DPP-4 inhibitor.  Sitagliptin had the greatest number of cases reported (n=28) followed by saxagliptin (n=5), linagliptin (n=2), alogliptin (n=1), and vildagliptin (n=2).
