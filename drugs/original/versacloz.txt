The most serious adverse reactions include agranulocytosis, seizure, cardiovascular effects, and fever.  The most common side effects include drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, tachycardia, constipation, and hypersalivation.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Leukopenia/decreased WBC/neutropenia, leukocytosisUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Eosinophilia, agranulocytosis Rare (less than 0.1%): AnemiaPostmarketing reports: Elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia[Ref]
During pre-marketing testing, the cumulative incidence of agranulocytosis at one year was reported to be 1.3%.  Based on Clozaril National Registry (US patients) data collected up to April 1995, a hematologic risk analysis found the incidence of agranulocytosis rises steeply during the first 2 months, peaks at approximately the third month, and decreases at 6 months of therapy; after 6 months the incidence decreases further, however, it never reaches zero.  Individuals with an initial episode of moderate leukopenia (WBC of at least 2000/mm3 and less than 3000/mm3) are at an increased risk of having a subsequent episode of agranulocytosis.  In clinical trials, eosinophil counts of greater than 700/mm3 occurred in approximately 1% of patients.  Eosinophilia has been co-reported with some cases of myocarditis (approximately 14%) and pericarditis/pericardial effusion, although it is unknown whether eosinophilia is a reliable predictor of carditis.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Weight gain (up to 31%)Rare (less than 0.1%): Diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose toleranceVery rare (less than 0.01%): Hyperosmolar coma, ketoacidosis, severe hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemiaPostmarketing reports: Hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, weight loss[Ref]
Pooled data from 8 studies in patients with schizophrenia found the mean change in fasting blood glucose in clozapine treated patients was +11 mg/dL; pooled data from 10 studies revealed clozapine treatment was associated a mean increase of 13 mg/dl in total cholesterol; pooled data from 11 studies showed a weight gain of 7% or greater relative to baseline body weight occurred in 35% of patients with a mean weight gain of 3.7 kg.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Drowsiness/sedation (39%), dizziness (up to 27%), headache (10%)Common (1% to 10%): Tremor, syncope, hypokinesia/akinesia, seizures, rigidity, akathisia, vertigo, dysarthria, extrapyramidal symptoms Frequency not reported: Dystonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesiaPostmarketing reports: Delirium/abnormal EEG, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, cholinergic syndrome[Ref]
The cumulative incidence of seizure at 1 year is approximately 5% based on pre-marketing testing.  The risk is dose-related.  Extrapyramidal symptoms that occur appear to be milder and less frequent than other antipsychotic drugs.  There have been no reports of tardive dyskinesia directly attributable to clozapine; however, the syndrome has been reported in a few patients who were treated with other antipsychotics prior to receiving clozapine.  A causal relationship can neither be established nor excluded.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Salivation (31%), hypersalivation (up to 48%), constipation (up to 25%), vomiting (up to 17%), nausea (up to 17%), dyspepsia (up to 14%)Common (1% to 10%): Dry mouth, abdominal discomfort/heartburn, diarrhea, anorexiaRare (less than 0.1%): DysphagiaVery rare (less than 0.01%): Ileus, parotid gland enlargement Postmarketing reports: Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Tachycardia (25%), hypotension (13%), hypertension (12%)Common (1% to 10%): ECG changesRare (less than 0.1%): Circulatory collapse, arrhythmia, myocarditis, pericarditis/pericardial effusionVery rare (less than 0.01%): Cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrestFrequency not reported: Deep vein thrombosisPostmarketing reports: Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de pointes, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, chest pain/angina pectoris[Ref]
Isolated cases of cardiac arrhythmias, pericarditis/pericardial effusion, and myocarditis have been reported.  Postmarketing, very rare events of ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, and QT prolongation which may be associated with Torsades de pointes have been observed, although there is no conclusive causal relationship to use of this drug.  Collective data gathered from 17 placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=5106) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death 1.6 to 1.7 times greater in the drug-treated patient than in the placebo-treated patient.  The average length of duration for the trials was 10 weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature.  Although clozapine was not included in these studies, the consistent findings across all three relevant chemical classes support the opinion that these findings are likely to be applicable to all atypical antipsychotic agents.  Clozapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Liver enzyme elevationsPostmarketing reports: Cholestasis, hepatitis, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, hepatic steatosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, liver injury (hepatic, cholestatic, and mixed), liver failure, liver transplant[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Insomnia (up to 20%)Common (1% to 10%): Disturbed sleep/nightmares, agitation, confusionUncommon (0.1% to 1%): DysphemiaPostmarketing reports: Obsessive compulsive symptoms, post-discontinuation cholinergic rebound adverse reactions[Ref]
