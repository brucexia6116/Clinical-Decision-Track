One analysis of 267 reports representing 6,217 patients, found that patients treated for rheumatic disorders (n=1131) reported a significantly higher rate of leukopenia and agranulocytosis (4.9%).  The majority of these patients (4.5%) discontinued therapy.  Leukopenia is usually not prodromal to agranulocytosis.Reports show some indication that agranulocytosis is due to a type II reaction (Coombs' classification).  Management of levamisole-induced agranulocytosis includes early diagnosis, discontinuation of treatment, and prevention of infection.  Agranulocytosis is spontaneously reversible when treatment is discontinued.[Ref]
Hematologic toxicity primarily involves (sometimes fatal) agranulocytosis.  Leukopenia has been reported in 2% (over 4,000/mm3), 4% (2,000 to 4,000/mm3), and less than 1% (less than 2,000/mm3).  Transient granulocytopenia has been reported in up to 20% of treated patients.  Recovery is usually spontaneous.  In patients with thrombocytopenia, 1% of patients show platelet counts over 130,000/mm3, and 1% show platelet counts between 50,000 and 130,000/mm3.[Ref]
Dermatologic side effects include dermatitis (8%), alopecia (3%), pruritus (1%) and urticaria (<1%).[Ref]
One analysis of 267 reports representing 6,217 patients, found that patients treated for rheumatic disorders (n=1131) reported a significantly high percentage of idiosyncratic or allergic reactions.  These included skin rash (14.8%).  Half of the patients experiencing skin rash discontinued therapy (7%).[Ref]
Flu-like symptoms including fatigue (6%), fever (3%), rigors (3%), myalgia, and malaise have been reported.[Ref]
Fever may be a symptom of infection associated with agranulocytosis, but often it is not.[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects include nausea (22%), diarrhea (13%), vomiting (6%), stomatitis (3%), anorexia (2%), abdominal pain (2%), and constipation (2%).  Flatulence and dyspepsia have also been reported.[Ref]
Cardiac dysfunction leading to edema (1%) and chest pain (<1%) have been reported.[Ref]
Musculoskeletal side effects including arthralgia (5%) and myalgia (3%) have been reported.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects including dizziness (3%), headache (3%), paresthesia (2%), taste perversion (8%), and an altered sense of smell (1%) have been reported.[Ref]
Psychiatric side effects including somnolence (3%), depression (1%), nervousness (1%), insomnia (1%), and anxiety (1%) have been reported.  Confusion, hallucinations, impaired concentration, nightmares, and an encephalopathy-like syndrome have also been reported.  A case has been reported of a psychotic episode which was believed to be caused by prolonged levamisole use.[Ref]
Ocular side effects including blurred vision (1%) and conjunctivitis (<1%) have been reported.  Periorbital edema has also been reported.[Ref]
Infection (5%) has been reported.[Ref]
Hyperbilirubinemia and increased alkaline phosphatase have been reported rarely.[Ref]
Renal failure and elevated serum creatinine have been reported rarely.  One case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone has been reported.[Ref]
Other adverse reactions including vaginal bleeding and anaphylaxis have been reported.[Ref]
