Other side effects include: hypothyroidism, and xerostomia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most commonly reported adverse effects in decreasing order of frequency included diarrhea/colitis, rash, acneiform dermatitis, hypertension, nausea, headache, upper respiratory tract infections, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain.  During clinical trials, treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 21% of patients.  Events leading to discontinuation included asthenia, rash, diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, elevated creatinine, QT prolongation, and hypertension.  Dose interruption occurred in 47% of patients and dose reduction in 36%.
Common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) grade 3 to 4 hypertension/hypertensive crisis/accelerated hypertension was reported in 9% of patients.  CTCAE grade 3 to 4 QT prolongation was reported in 8% of patients.  Among patients who experienced QT prolongation, 69% experienced a QT interval Fridericia (QTcF) greater than 450 milliseconds (msec) with 7% having reported a QTcF greater than 500 msec.  In a pharmacodynamics study in patients with medullary thyroid cancer receiving vandetanib (the active ingredient contained in Caprelsa) 300 mg orally once daily, mean change in QTcF was 35 msec and mean change in QTcF remained above 30 msec for the duration of the trial (up to 2 years).  A change in QTcF greater than 60 msec was reported in 36% of patients experience and 4.3% of patients had a QTcF greater than 500 msec.
