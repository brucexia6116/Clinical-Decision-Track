If any of the following side effects occur while taking ceftriaxone, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
Some ceftriaxone side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:


Applies to ceftriaxone: injectable powder for injection, intramuscular kit, intravenous solution
This drug was generally well tolerated.  The most common side effects were eosinophilia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, rash, and increased hepatic enzymes.  Incidence of side effects was somewhat higher in children and with higher doses.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Warmth/tightness/induration with IM injection (up to 17%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Injection site pain/discomfort, injection site induration, injection site tenderness, phlebitis after IV administration[Ref]
Local side effects were increased if water was used as the diluent instead of lidocaine (lignocaine).IM injection has been associated with warmth, tightness, and induration in 17% of patients receiving the 350 mg/mL solution and 5% of patients receiving the 250 mg/mL solution.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Eosinophilia, thrombocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropeniaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Anemia, granulocytopenia, coagulopathy, hemolytic anemia, lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin timeRare (less than 0.1%): Agranulocytosis, lymphocytosis, leukocytosis, monocytosis, basophilia, decreased prothrombin time, hemolysis (fatal)Frequency not reported: Bleeding, hypoprothrombinemiaPostmarketing reports: Coombs' test false positiveCephalosporin class:-Frequency not reported: Aplastic anemia, hemorrhage, positive direct Coombs' test[Ref]
Nineteen cases (10 adults, 9 children) of immune hemolytic anemia have been reported, 9 of which were fatal.  Symptoms occurred within minutes or weeks of drug administration.  Initial symptoms included tachycardia, hypotension, dyspnea, pallor, back or leg pain, and decreased hemoglobin levels.  Most of these patients had preexisting hematologic or immunodeficiency disorders, and 1 had Crohn's disease.Bleeding and bruising (due to hypoprothrombinemia) may have been more prevalent in patients with liver or renal dysfunction, malnourished patients, patients with low vitamin K levels, and patients using this drug for a prolonged duration.Hemolytic anemia and agranulocytosis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.  Most cases of agranulocytosis (less than 500/mm3) were after 10 days of therapy and after total doses of at least 20 g.[Ref]
Shadows on sonograms of the gallbladder (mistaken for gallstones, but actually ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates) have been reported, primarily after doses higher than the standard recommended dose.  Prospective studies showed variable incidence of precipitation with IV administration in children (more than 30% in some studies), but slow infusion (20 to 30 minutes) appeared to lower the incidence.  Risk of forming precipitates was increased by duration of therapy exceeding 14 days, renal failure, dehydration, or total parenteral nutrition.  Effect was usually asymptomatic, but clinical symptoms (e.g., pain, nausea, vomiting) have been reported.  Precipitation was usually reversible upon drug discontinuation.Both pseudocholelithiasis (biliary "sludging") and true cholelithiasis (ceftriaxone-containing gallstone) have been reported in association with doses greater than 2 g/day.  A false-positive hepatobiliary scan occurred in a patient receiving this drug.  A repeat test 2 weeks after this drug was discontinued was normal.Hepatitis has also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Increased hepatic enzymes, increased ALT, increased ASTUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increased bilirubinRare (less than 0.1%): Hepatitis, jaundice, gallbladder sludge, biliary lithiasis, cholestatic jaundiceFrequency not reported: Transient elevations in liver function tests, shadows on sonograms of the gallbladder, cholelithiasis, pseudocholelithiasis, false-positive hepatobiliary scanPostmarketing reports: Gallbladder precipitationCephalosporin class:-Frequency not reported: Hepatic dysfunction, cholestasis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea/loose stoolsUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Nausea, vomitingRare (less than 0.1%): Colitis, flatulence, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, pseudomembranous colitisFrequency not reported: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrheaPostmarketing reports: Pancreatitis, stomatitis, glossitis[Ref]
The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms has been reported during or after antimicrobial treatment.[Ref]
A case of AGEP has been reported after administration of this drug.  This was characterized by the appearance of an erythematous and generalized scarlatiniform rash with plaques covered by small nonfollicular pustules on the thighs, abdomen, and lower extremities.  This drug was discontinued and the AGEP was completely resolved after 2 weeks.Allergic dermatitis and urticaria have also been reported during postmarketing experience.A case of occupational contact dermatitis has been reported in a nurse who prepared cephalosporin solutions for administration to patients.  The dermatitis resolved after the nurse stopped preparing the solutions.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): RashUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pruritus, maculopapular rash/exanthema, allergic dermatitis, diaphoresisRare (less than 0.1%): UrticariaFrequency not reported: Severe dermatitis, exfoliative erythroderma, bruisingPostmarketing reports: Exanthema, severe cutaneous reactions, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Lyell's syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)Cephalosporin class:-Frequency not reported: Contact dermatitis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Increased BUN/serum ureaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increased blood creatinineRare (less than 0.1%): Renal precipitations, nephrolithiasis, acute renal tubular necrosisPostmarketing reports: Oliguria, ureteric obstruction, post-renal acute renal failureCephalosporin class:-Frequency not reported: Renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy[Ref]
Cases of renal precipitation have been reported, primarily in children older than 3 years who received either high daily doses (e.g., at least 80 mg/kg/day) or total doses exceeding 10 g and who had other risk factors (e.g., fluid restrictions, confinement to bed).  Risk of forming precipitates was increased in immobilized or dehydrated patients.  Precipitation was reversible upon drug discontinuation.Renal precipitation has also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Genital fungal infection, urinary casts, candidiasis, vaginitisRare (less than 0.1%): Glycosuria, hematuria, crystalluria[Ref]
Severe and sometimes fatal reactions have been reported in term and premature newborns (younger than 28 days) treated with IV ceftriaxone (the active ingredient contained in Rocephin) and calcium-containing IV solutions; a crystalline material (ceftriaxone-calcium precipitate) has been observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy.  The same IV infusion line was used for this drug and calcium-containing solutions in some cases; precipitate was observed in the IV infusion line in some cases.  Ceftriaxone and calcium-containing solutions infused at different times by different IV lines resulted in at least 1 neonate fatality; there was no crystalline material observed at autopsy.Edema has also been reported during postmarketing experience.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Pyrexia/fever, flushingRare (less than 0.1%): Edema, chills, drug fever, shiveringPostmarketing reports: Superinfection with nonsusceptible microorganisms, ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates/crystalline materialCephalosporin class:-Frequency not reported: Drug fever, superinfection[Ref]

An allergic reaction manifested by itching, maculopapular rash, hyperthermia, flushing has been reported in a patient with X-linked agammaglobulinemia in the absence of IgE.  T cell involvement was proposed as the mechanism.Cross-sensitivity with other cephalosporins and penicillins has occurred; however, the incidence is unknown.[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Anaphylaxis/anaphylactic-type reactions (e.g., bronchospasms), serum sicknessFrequency not reported: Allergic reaction, cross-sensitivityPostmarketing reports: Anaphylaxis (anaphylactic shock, transient leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia), anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, hypersensitivityCephalosporin class:-Frequency not reported: Allergic reactions, serum sickness-like reaction[Ref]
