In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by foscarnet. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.

If any of the following side effects occur while taking foscarnet, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
Some of the side effects that can occur with foscarnet may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:

Renal impairment was the major toxicity of this drug.  The most frequent side effects reported during clinical trials included fever, nausea, anemia, diarrhea, abnormal renal function, vomiting, headache, and seizures.  Severe side effects included death, abnormal renal function, bone marrow suppression, anemia, and seizures.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Renal impairment (up to 33%), abnormal renal function (up to 27%), increased serum creatinineCommon (1% to 10%): Altered renal function, decreased CrCl, increased BUN, acute renal failure, renal painUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Renal tubular disorderFrequency not reported: Increased serum creatinine to greater than 2.9 mg/dL, acute tubular necrosis, drug crystals in renal tubules and capillaries, nephrotoxicityPostmarketing reports: Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis, renal calculus, renal tubular necrosis, crystal-induced nephropathy[Ref]
About 33% of AIDS patients with CMV retinitis who used this drug without adequate hydration reported significant renal impairment (serum creatinine at least 2 mg/dL).  When administered with 1000 mL of normal saline or 5% dextrose solution, the incidence decreased to 12%.Renal side effects were due to acute tubular necrosis, possibly from deposition of drug crystals in the renal tubules and capillaries.  The development of nephrotoxicity was most common during the third week of therapy in 1 study.Nephrotoxicity was reversible in patients with previously adequate renal function.  Hydration with 2.5 liters of normal saline per day beginning the day before therapy decreased the incidence of nephrotoxicity.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Serum electrolyte changes, mineral and electrolyte imbalances, hypokalemia (up to 48%), hypocalcemia (up to 30%), hypomagnesemia (up to 30%), hypophosphatemia (up to 26%), decreased appetite, anorexiaCommon (1% to 10%): Hyperphosphatemia, abnormal albumin to globulin ratio, hyponatremia, decreased weight, increased alkaline phosphatase, increased lactate dehydrogenase, acidosis, cachexia, thirstUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Dehydration, hypoproteinemiaFrequency not reported: Hypercalcemia., decreased serum ionized calcium levels[Ref]
The higher percentages of serum electrolyte changes (including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperphosphatemia) were reported in patients receiving hydration.Serum ionized calcium levels have been shown to decrease acutely in a dose-dependent manner after an infusion of this drug.  Total calcium and phosphate levels were not significantly affected.  This drug is believed to complex with ionized calcium.More severe metabolic abnormalities have resulted in tremors, twitches, arrhythmias, paresthesias, and seizures.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Nausea (up to 47%), diarrhea (up to 30%), vomiting (up to 26%)Common (1% to 10%): Abdominal pain, constipation, dysphagia, dyspepsia, rectal hemorrhage, dry mouth, melena, flatulence, ulcerative stomatitis, pancreatitisUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increased amylaseFrequency not reported: Uvula ulcerationPostmarketing reports: Esophageal ulceration[Ref]
In controlled trials, death was specifically attributed to this drug in 1 case; however, other drug complications (e.g., renal impairment, electrolyte abnormalities, seizures) may have contributed to patient deaths.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Fever/pyrexia (up to 65%), death (up to 14%), fatigue, asthenia, chillsCommon (1% to 10%): Rigors, malaise, pain, infection, sepsis, chest pain, edema, influenza-like symptoms, bacterial infections, moniliasis, fungal infections, abscess, facial edemaFrequency not reported: Catheterization-related infection, hospitalization, drug accumulation in teeth and bones[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Anemia (up to 33%), granulocytopenia (up to 17%), decreased hemoglobinCommon (1% to 10%): Marrow suppression, neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, platelet abnormalities, thrombosis, white blood cell abnormalities, lymphadenopathyUncommon (0.1% to 1%): PancytopeniaFrequency not reported: Decreased absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L, hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL[Ref]
Risk factors for drug-related seizures included underlying central nervous system conditions predisposing patients to seizures, impaired baseline renal function, and low total serum calcium.  The rate of seizures did not increase with duration of therapy.  At least 3 cases were reported with overdoses of this drug.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Headache (up to 26%), paresthesia, dizzinessCommon (1% to 10%): Seizures/convulsion (including grand mal seizures), involuntary muscle contractions, hypoesthesia, neuropathy, tremor, ataxia, dementia, stupor, generalized spasms, sensory disturbances, meningitis, aphasia, abnormal coordination, leg cramps, electroencephalogram abnormalities, amnesia, somnolence, taste perversions, peripheral neuropathyUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Coma, other neurologic complicationsPostmarketing reports: Encephalopathy[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): RashCommon (1% to 10%): Increased sweating, pruritus, skin ulceration, seborrhea, erythematous rash, maculopapular rash, skin discolorationFrequency not reported: Eosinophilic folliculitisPostmarketing reports: Vesiculobullous eruptions, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome[Ref]
When toxic epidermal necrolysis or Stevens-Johnson syndrome was reported, patients were usually taking other agents associated with those reactions.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Injection site pain, injection site inflammation[Ref]

Serum electrolytes were within normal limits.Thrombophlebitis in peripheral veins has been reported after infusion of undiluted drug solution.[Ref]

High levels of this drug are excreted in the urine and may be associated with significant irritation and ulceration in the genital area, especially after prolonged therapy.Penile ulcerations have been reported to occur after a median of 11 days of induction therapy and 30 days of maintenance therapy, and healed within 6 days of drug discontinuation.  Ulceration has been reported more often in uncircumcised patients.[Ref]
