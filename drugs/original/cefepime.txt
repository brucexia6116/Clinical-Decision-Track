Applies to cefepime: injection powder for solution
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by cefepime. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.

If any of the following side effects occur while taking cefepime, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
Some of the side effects that can occur with cefepime may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:


Applies to cefepime: injectable powder for injection, injectable solution
Cefepime is generally well tolerated.  It has been reported that 1.5% of patients discontinued medication due to adverse events.[Ref]
If diarrhea occurs which is unresponsive to discontinuation of cefepime and/or standard therapy, pseudomembranous colitis should be considered.Higher doses (2 grams every 8 hours) have been associated with a greater incidence of side effects, including diarrhea (3%), nausea (2%), and vomiting (1%).[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Colitis (including pseudomembranous colitis), diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, oral moniliasisFrequency not reported: Abdominal pain, anorexia, stomatitis, Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Local reactions (3%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Phlebitis (1.3%), pain and/or inflammation (0.6%)Frequency not reported: Infusion site reaction[Ref]
Local reactions (3%), including phlebitis (1.3%) and pain and/or inflammation (0.6%), have been reported irrespective to cefepime in patients who received intravenous infusion.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): HeadacheFrequency not reported: SomnolencePostmarketing reports: Neurotoxicity, encephalopathy (disturbance of consciousness including confusion, hallucinations, stupor, coma), myoclonus, seizures, nonconvulsive status epilepticus[Ref]
Encephalopathy, myoclonus, seizures, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus have been reported.  Although most cases occurred in patients with renal impairment who received higher than recommended doses of cefepime, some cases of neurotoxicity occurred in patients receiving an appropriate dosage for their degree of renal impairment.  In the majority of cases, symptoms of neurotoxicity were reversible and resolved after discontinuation of cefepime and/or after hemodialysis.Case reports of seizure activity, with and without convulsions, associated with cefepime have been published in the medical literature.  In the vast majority of cases, the patient involved had a clinically significant degree of renal dysfunction.  In each case, seizure activity abated upon the discontinuation of cefepime.Higher doses (2 grams every 8 hours) have been associated with a greater incidence of side effects, including headache (1%).A 66-year-old female developed acute renal failure, altered level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale 6), and nonconvulsive status epilepticus after 10 days of cefepime 2 g every 8 hours.  Symptoms resolved and she completely recovered 72 hours after discontinuation of cefepime.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Rash (1.1%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Urticaria, pruritus, erythemaRare (less than 0.1%): Red man syndrome (at least 1 case)Frequency not reported: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis[Ref]
Higher doses (2 grams every 8 hours) have been associated with a higher incidence of side effects, including rash (4%) and pruritus (1%).Cephalosporin class antibiotics have been associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.[Ref]
Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, prolonged prothrombin time, hemorrhage, and pancytopenia.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Positive Coombs' test (without hemolysis; 16.2%)Common (1% to 10%): Increased eosinophils (1.7%), abnormal PTT (1.6%), abnormal PT (1.4%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Decreased hematocrit, decreased neutrophils, decreased platelets, decreased white blood cells, anemiaFrequency not reported: Epistaxis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, prolonged prothrombin time, hemorrhage, pancytopenia[Ref]
Anaphylactic reactions are rare, but may occur, especially in patients with a history of penicillin allergy.Cephalosporin class antibiotics have been associated with allergic reactions.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis, allergic reactionsPostmarketing reports: Anaphylaxis (including anaphylactic shock, transient leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia)[Ref]
Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Increased ALT (2.8%), increased AST (2.4%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increased alkaline phosphatase, increased total bilirubinFrequency not reported: Hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis[Ref]
Hypocalcemia was more common among elderly patients.  Clinical consequences from changes in either calcium or phosphorus were not reported.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Decreased phosphorus (2.8%)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Decreased calcium, increased calcium, increased phosphorus, increased potassiumFrequency not reported: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia[Ref]
Higher doses (2 grams every 8 hours) have been associated with a greater incidence of side effects, including fever (1%).[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Fever[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Increased BUN, increased creatinineFrequency not reported: Renal failure, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy[Ref]
Renal failure, mostly in patients with renal impairment who received higher than recommended doses of cefepime, has been reported.Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with renal dysfunction and toxic nephropathy.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Vaginitis[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Cough, dyspnea[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Tachycardia[Ref]
