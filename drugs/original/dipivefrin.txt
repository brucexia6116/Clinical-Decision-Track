Corneal vascularization or vesicles, eyelid ectropion, papillary conjunctivitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, macular edema, corneal toxicity (dendritic keratitis, punctate keratitis, or epitheliopathy), and blurred vision have also been reported.Ocular side effects associated with ocular administration of epinephrine have included conjunctival and corneal adrenochrome deposits.[Ref]
Some long-term studies have reported observations of follicular conjunctivitis in almost all patients with up to 40% classified as severe reactions.[Ref]
Cardiovascular side effects have included slight increases in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure.Cardiovascular side effects associated with ocular epinephrine have included  tachycardia, arrhythmias, and hypertension.[Ref]
