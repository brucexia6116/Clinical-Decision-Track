Commonly reported side effects of lovastatin include: increased creatine phosphokinase and increased serum transaminases.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Applies to lovastatin: oral tablet, oral tablet extended release
In addition to its needed effects, some unwanted effects may be caused by lovastatin. In the event that any of these side effects do occur, they may require medical attention.
You should check with your doctor immediately if any of these side effects occur when taking lovastatin:
Some of the side effects that can occur with lovastatin may not need medical attention. As your body adjusts to the medicine during treatment these side effects may go away. Your health care professional may also be able to tell you about ways to reduce or prevent some of these side effects. If any of the following side effects continue, are bothersome or if you have any questions about them, check with your health care professional:

Persistent elevations in liver function tests to three times normal values have been reported in up to 2% of patients on lovastatin in clinical trials.  Overall, 1.5% of patients were withdrawn from study due to elevations in serum transaminases.  While most patients remained asymptomatic with these elevations, cases of cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis have been reported.Liver function tests should be closely monitored.  Lovastatin should be discontinued in patients with persistent, significant elevations (three times the upper limit of normal) in liver function parameters.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Elevations in liver function testsFrequency not reported: Hepatitis (including chronic active hepatitis), cholestatic jaundice, fatty change in the liver, cirrhosis, fulminant hepatic necrosis[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nauseaFrequency not reported: Dyspepsia, heartburn, anorexia, vomitingPostmarketing reports: Abdominal discomfort[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects are among the most common complaints in patients on lovastatin.  These effects tend to be mild and transient in nature and will often dissipate with continued therapy.[Ref]
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been associated with rare cases of severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, accompanied by increases in creatine kinase, myoglobinuria, proteinuria, and renal failure.  These conditions appear to be dose related, usually occurring with doses greater than 30 mg per day.  The incidence and severity of myopathy may be increased by concomitant administration of lovastatin with drugs that can cause myopathy when given alone, such as gemfibrozil and other fibrates, niacin, and potent inhibitors of CYP450 3A4 (i.e., cyclosporine, antifungal azoles, macrolide antibiotics, large amounts of grapefruit juice).  Other variables associated with an increased risk of statin-induced myopathy include, advanced age, small body stature, female gender, renal and/or hepatic dysfunction, perioperative periods, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and alcoholism.  Milder forms of myotoxicity (i.e., myalgia) are commonly reported and occur in approximately 5% to 7% of patients taking a statin drug.Patients should be instructed to report promptly symptoms of muscle pain, weakness, or tenderness.  If such symptoms develop, creatine kinase should be measured, and if markedly elevated, lovastatin should be discontinued.  The value of routine monitoring of creatine kinase is not known.  In some studies up to 11% of patients experienced elevations in creatine kinase while on lovastatin.  In most cases these elevations were mild, transient, and not associated with clinical symptoms.Itraconazole used concomitantly with lovastatin has led to one reported case of severe rhabdomyolysis in a 63-year-old woman.  Caution should be exercised when HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and azole antifungals are prescribed concurrently.Exposure to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is associated with a decreased risk of bone fractures in persons older than 50.[Ref]
