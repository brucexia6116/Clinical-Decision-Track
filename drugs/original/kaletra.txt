Applies to lopinavir / ritonavir: oral capsule, oral liquid, oral tablet
In clinical studies, this drug was used with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with or without efavirenz or nevirapine.  The most common side effects were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia.  Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting occurred more often at the start of therapy while hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia generally occurred later.  Diarrhea was reported more often when this drug was used once a day than when it was used twice a day.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Diarrhea (up to 19.5%), nausea (up to 10.3%)Common (1% to 10%): Increased amylase, vomiting, abdominal pain (upper and lower), increased lipase, gastroenteritis and colitis, dyspepsia, pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoids, flatulence, abdominal distention, constipationUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Stomatitis and oral ulcers, duodenitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (including rectal hemorrhage), dry mouth, gastrointestinal ulcer, fecal incontinenceFrequency not reported: Abnormal feces, dysphagia, abdominal discomfort, enteritis, enterocolitis, eructation, esophagitis, gastric disorder, gastric ulcer, hemorrhagic enterocolitis, mouth ulceration, periodontitis, sialadenitis, stomach discomfort, ulcerative stomatitis[Ref]

Although a causal relationship has not been established, marked triglyceride elevation is a risk factor for the development of pancreatitis.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Increased total cholesterol (up to 39%), increased triglycerides (up to 36%)Common (1% to 10%): Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased glucose, increased uric acid, decreased weight, decreased appetite, decreased inorganic phosphorus, blood glucose disorders (including diabetes mellitus)Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Lactic acidosis, increased appetite, anorexiaFrequency not reported: Avitaminosis, hypovitaminosis, dehydration, dyslipidemia, hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia, decreased glucose tolerance, lipomatosis, obesity, hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus, ketoacidosis, insulin resistance, hyperlactatemiaPostmarketing reports: Redistribution/accumulation of body fat (including central obesity, dorsocervical fat enlargement, peripheral wasting, facial wasting, breast enlargement, "cushingoid appearance")[Ref]
Increased total cholesterol (greater than 300 mg/dL), triglycerides (greater than 750 mg/dL), glucose (greater than 250 mg/dL), and uric acid (greater than 12 mg/dL) have been reported in up to 39%, up to 36%, up to 5%, and up to 5% of patients, respectively.  Decreased inorganic phosphorus (less than 1.5 mg/dL) has been reported in up to 2% of patients.Episodes of hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus have been reported during postmarketing studies in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors.  In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred.  No causal relationship has been established.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Increased GGT (up to 29%), increased ALT (up to 11%)Common (1% to 10%): Increased AST, hepatitis (including increased AST, ALT, GGT), increased total bilirubinUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Hepatomegaly, cholangitis, hepatic steatosis, hyperbilirubinemiaFrequency not reported: Fatty liver deposit, cytolytic hepatitis, liver tenderness, hepatic failure, cholecystitis, hepatic dysfunctionPostmarketing reports: Jaundice[Ref]

There have been reports of hepatic dysfunction with some cases leading to death.  A causal relationship with this drug has not been proven since these cases have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV who also had underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and were taking multiple concomitant medications.[Ref]
