Applies to insulin lispro: subcutaneous solution
Adverse reactions observed have included hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, local injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, rash, and pruritus.[Ref]
Weight gain has been reported with insulin therapy and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): HypoglycemiaFrequency not reported: Weight gain[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis[Ref]
Hypersensitivity side effects have included both local and systemic reactions.  Anaphylaxis has been reported.  Local reactions have presented as erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the injection site.  Most minor reactions to insulin at the injection site resolve in a few days to a few weeks.  Generalized allergy to insulin may present as a whole body rash, dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis.  In clinical trials, pruritus (with or without rash) was seen in 17 patients receiving human insulin (n=2969) and 30 patients receiving insulin lispro (n=2944).[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Infusion site reactions Rare (less than 0.1%): Catheter occlusions/month[Ref]
Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder and worsening of diabetic retinopathy.  However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Refraction disorder, worsening of diabetic retinopathy[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Headache (up to 29.6%)Rare (less than 0.1%): Painful peripheral neuropathy[Ref]
Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory, reversible acute painful peripheral neuropathy.  However, long-term glycemic control decreases the risk.[Ref]
The clinical significance of the development of these antibody titers is unknown.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Flu syndrome (up to 34.6%), infection (up to 13.6%)Frequency not reported: Anti-insulin antibody titers[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Peripheral edema[Ref]
Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, especially as metabolic control is improving.[Ref]
Long-term use of insulin may cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated injection.  Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy, a thickening of adipose tissue, and lipoatrophy, thinning of adipose tissue.[Ref]
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Urticaria, rash Frequency not reported: Lipodystrophy including lipohypertrophy and lipoatrophy[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infection, dysmenorrhea[Ref]
