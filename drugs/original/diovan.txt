A 71-year-old woman experienced an acute onset of angioedema and a photosensitive pruritic rash after 3 months of valsartan (the active ingredient contained in Diovan) therapy.  Her symptoms dissipated and the rash resolved after treatment with subcutaneous epinephrine, intravenous methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, and emollient cream.A unique case of dose-dependent, valsartan-induced angioedema has been reported.  Two hours after initiating a dose increase (160 to 320 mg/day) of valsartan, a patient developed angioedema (i.e., swelling of lips and tongue).  Symptoms resolved following a reduction in dose to the original dosage of 160 mg/day.

Valsartan-associated hepatotoxicity in a patient with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs-Ag) positivity (without signs and symptoms) has been reported.  After 1 month of treatment with valsartan (the active ingredient contained in Diovan)  this patient developed pruritic erythematous skin changes, nausea, jaundice, right subcostal abdominal pain, elevated liver enzymes, and mild hepatomegaly.  Signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity resolved within 2 to 3 weeks following discontinuation of valsartan and the patient remained asymptomatic after 6 months of follow-up.
