Common side effects of Chenodal include: increased serum alanine aminotransferase.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Hepatic side effects have included dose-related serum aminotransferase (mainly SGPT) elevations, usually not accompanied byrises in alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin, occurring in 30% or more of patients treated with the recommended dose of chenodeoxycholic acid (the active ingredient contained in Chenodal)   In most cases, these elevations were minor (1Â½ to 3 times the upper limit of laboratory normal) andtransient, returning to within the normal range within six months despite continued administration of the drug.Morphologic studies of liver biopsies taken before and after 9 and 24 months of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid have shown that 63% of the patients prior to chenodiol treatment had evidence of intrahepatic cholestasis.  Almost all pretreatment patients had electron microscopic abnormalities.  By the ninth month of treatment, reexamination of two-thirds of the patients showed an 89% incidence of the signs of intrahepatic cholestasis.  Two of 89 patients at the ninth month had lithocholate-like lesions in the canalicular membrane, although there were not clinical enzyme abnormalities in the face of continued treatment and no change in Type 2 light microscopic parameters.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included diarrhea in 30% to 40% of patients and may occur at any time during treatment, but is most commonly encountered when treatment is initiated.  Usually, the diarrhea is mild, translucent, well-tolerated and does notinterfere with therapy.  Other less frequent, gastrointestinal side effects reported include urgency, cramps, heartburn, constipation, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, epigastric distress, dyspepsia, flatulence and nonspecific abdominal pain.
Hematologic side effects have included decreases in white cell count but the drug was continued in all patients without incident.
Metabolic side effects have included serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increases of 10% or more during drug administration; no change has been seen in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction; small decreases in serum triglyceride levels for females have been reported.
