Common side effects of Bumex include: hypokalemia and hyperuricemia.  See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Metabolic side effects associated with bumetanide (the active ingredient contained in Bumex)  as with other loop diuretics, occur in 7% to 20% of patients, and include hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and hyperuricemia.  These side effects may be more likely in patients with renal insufficiency.  Glucose intolerance is reported in up to 14% of elderly patients.  Hypokalemia may lead to increased renal tubular bicarbonate reabsorption, resulting in metabolic alkalosis.
Besides acting on the loop of Henle, bumetanide also inhibits phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, resulting in phosphaturia.  Since phosphorous is abundant in most diets, bumetanide-induced phosphaturia may not be significant except in malnourished patients, patients on life support, and patients with significant muscle weakness.Calcium balance appears to remain neutral during treatment with a loop diuretic (i.e., furosemide, bumetanide).  Although loop diuretics cause an increase in renal calcium excretion, this appears to be compensated for by a parathyroid-dependent increase in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels, which increases intestinal calcium absorption.  Bone metabolism does not appear to be significantly affected by loop diuretics.
Musculoskeletal side effects have included muscle cramps in 1.1% and weakness in 0.2% of patients.
Renal insufficiency, manifested as a rise in serum creatinine and BUN, may occur in up to 7% of patients.  It is usually due to extracellular fluid volume depletion and is readily reversible.
Cardiovascular side effects include hypotension in less than 2% of patients.  Patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias should be monitored closely because of the risk of hypokalemia.
Gastrointestinal side effects were reported in less than 2% of patients and included nausea, vomiting, loose stools, and constipation.  There have been rare reports of hyperamylasemia and pancreatitis associated with bumetanide (the active ingredient contained in Bumex) use.
Nervous system side effects, such as headache, dizziness, deafness, tinnitus, vertigo, and decreased hearing, are reported in less than 2% of patients.  Encephalopathy after bumetanide (the active ingredient contained in Bumex) administration is reported in patients with severe liver disease.
Severe hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and recurrent urticaria have been reported in rare cases.
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare.  Rash is reported in less than 1% of treated patients.  Because cross-reactivity with furosemide is rare, bumetanide can be substituted at about a 1:40 dose ratio of bumetanide to furosemide in patients allergic to furosemide.
Dermatologic side effects have included pseudoporphyria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Hematologic side effects are extremely rare.  Cases of thrombocytopenia, mild anemia, and leukopenia have been reported.
