Physicians should carefully consider whether the risks of abarelix outweigh the benefits in patients with baseline QTc values >450 msec and in patients taking class IA or class III antiarrhythmic medications.

Gastrointestinal side effects including constipation (15%), diarrhea (11%), and nausea (10%) have been reported.

Hypersensitivity side effects including immediate-onset allergic reactions (3.7%), sometimes resulting in hypotension and syncope, have been reported to have occurred after administration of abarelix.
The allergic reaction included urticaria, pruritus, hypotension, and syncope.Immediate-onset reactions have been reported to have occurred following any administration of abarelix, including the initial dose.  The cumulative risk for such a reaction increases with the duration of treatment.  Following each injection of abarelix, patients should be observed for at least 30 minutes in the office.  If an allergic reaction associated with hypotension and/or syncope does occur, supportive measures such as leg elevation, oxygen, IV fluids, antihistamines, corticosteroids, and epinephrine should be administered as needed.
Hepatic side effects including clinically meaningful increases in serum transaminases have been reported in a small percentage of patients.
Hematologic side effects including slight decreases in hemoglobin and mean increases in serum triglycerides of approximately 10% have been reported.
