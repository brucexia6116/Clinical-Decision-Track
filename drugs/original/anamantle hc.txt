Local side effects have included erythema, edema, transient stinging, burning, transient blanching, and locus of abnormal sensation.Local side effects associated with topical hydrocortisone have included burning, itching, or irritation, especially if applied to denuded skin or with occlusive dressings.  Long-term use of topical corticosteroids may result in skin atrophy and thinning, and the development of striae, telangiectasia, subcutaneous hemorrhage, and easy bruising and bleeding.  Allergic contact dermatitis is occasionally reported.
Endocrine side effects of topical corticosteroids are rare.  Glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia may be induced by corticosteroids.  These drugs can rarely suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  This suppression is more likely when higher potency topical steroids are used over extensive areas and when occlusive dressings are used.
