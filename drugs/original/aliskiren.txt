Two cases of angioedema with respiratory symptoms were reported with aliskiren use in clinical studies, and two other cases of periorbital edema without respiratory symptoms were reported as possible angioedema and resulted in discontinuation.  The rate of angioedema cases in completed studies was 0.06%.  Twenty-six other cases of edema involving the face, hands, or whole body were reported with aliskiren use, including four which led to discontinuation.  In the placebo controlled studies, the incidence of edema involving the face, hands or whole body was 0.4% with aliskiren compared with 0.5% with placebo.
Frequency not reported: Angioedema (face, hands, and body) with or without respiratory symptomsPostmarketing reports: Angioedema
In women and the elderly (65 years of age or older), increases in diarrhea rates were evident starting at a dose of 150 mg daily.  Diarrhea and other GI symptoms were typically mild and rarely led to discontinuation.
Common (1% to 10%): Diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux (these side effects appear to be dose related)Postmarketing reports: Nausea, vomiting
Common (1% to 10%): RashRare (less than 0.1%): Angioedema (involving the face, hands, or whole body)Postmarketing reports: Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (including Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis)
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Elevated uric acid, gout, renal stonesPostmarketing reports: Peripheral edema, hyponatremia
Episodes of tonic-clonic seizures were reported in two patients treated with aliskiren in the clinical trials.  One patient had predisposing causes for seizures and a negative electroencephalogram (EEG) and cerebral imaging following the seizures (the other patient's EEG and imaging results were not reported).  Aliskiren was discontinued and there was no rechallenge.
Frequency not reported: Headache, dizziness, fatigue, episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with loss of consciousness.
Frequency not reported: Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, cough
Rare (less than 0.1%): Hypotension
Uncommon (0.1% to 1%): Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit Postmarketing reports: Increased blood creatinine
Common (1% to 10%): Back pain
Rare (less than 0.1%): ParosmiaFrequency not reported: Tinnitus
