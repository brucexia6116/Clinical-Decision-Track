This drug has lesser affinity for isoenzyme PDE6, an enzyme found in the retina.

Four of the five patients had no vascular risk factors for ischemic optic neuropathy.-Abnormal Vision: Mild to moderate and transient, predominantly color tinge to vision, but also increased sensitivity to light, or blurred vision.-Visual color distortions: Chloropsia, chromatopsia, cyanopsia, erythropsia and xanthopsia -Lacrimation disorders: Dry eye, lacrimal disorder and lacrimation increased[Ref]
