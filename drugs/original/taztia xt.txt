Common (1% to 10%): MyalgiaFrequency not reported: Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increase, muscle cramp, osteoarticular pain, myopathy, muscle pain, muscle weakness, neck rigidity
Dizziness occurred more frequently with higher doses.
Common (1% to 10%): MyalgiaFrequency not reported: Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increase, muscle cramp, osteoarticular pain, myopathy, muscle pain, muscle weakness, neck rigidity
