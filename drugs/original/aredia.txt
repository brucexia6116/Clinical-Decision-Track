Applies to pamidronate: intravenous powder for injection, intravenous solution
This drug has been generally well tolerated and many adverse effects that occurred during treatment may have been related to the underlying disease state.  Adverse effects have been most often associated with larger (90 mg) doses of pamidronate (the active ingredient contained in Aredia)   The most common adverse effect has been fever, occurring in up to 41% of patients.  The fever was generally mild and transient.  Onset was typically within the first 48 hours after infusion and resolution was within another 48 hours.[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, gastritis, dyspepsia[Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Urinary tract infection (15%)Common (1% to 10%): Moniliasis[Ref]
Presentation of hypocalcemia may be delayed.  In one case report, the patient presented with fingertip paresthesias and a serum calcium of 6.8 mEq/L (7.8 mEq/mL, corrected) 13 days after a single infusion of pamidronate (the active ingredient contained in Aredia) [Ref]
Very common (10% or more): Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, anorexia, fluid overloadCommon (1% to 10%): Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemiaVery rare (less than 0.01%): Hyperkalemia, hypernatremia[Ref]

Leukopenia was generally mild and transient.  In one study, granulocytopenia occurred in 4.2% of patients but completely resolved after discontinuation of pamidronate therapy.  Patients with anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia prior to initiation of pamidronate should be carefully monitored during the first 2 weeks of therapy.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): Reactions at the infusion site (pain, redness, swelling, induration, phlebitis, thrombophlebitis)[Ref]

Uveitis generally occurs within 24 to 48 hours after administration of pamidronate (the active ingredient contained in Aredia)   The uveitis may be bilateral, and reversible, partial 3rd and 4th nerve palsies have been reported with the uveitis.  Recurrences have occurred with rechallenge of the drug.  Therapy with pamidronate should be discontinued if uveitis occurs.  Although severe cases have been reported, most symptoms have resolved on discontinuation of pamidronate with minimal or no intervention.A nonspecific conjunctivitis has been reported with pamidronate use. The conjunctivitis may consist of any or all of the following symptoms: conjunctival hyperemia, irritation, epiphora, discharge, and blurred vision. These symptoms may appear within the first 6 to 48 hours after administration of the drug and generally resolve within a few days after drug discontinuation.[Ref]
