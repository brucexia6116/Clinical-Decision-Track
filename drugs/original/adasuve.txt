The most common adverse reactions reported with use of the inhaler were dysgeusia, sedation and throat irritation.  Drowsiness, extrapyramidal reactions and akathisia have been reported frequently, especially during the first few days of oral therapy.
Very common (10% or more): Sedation (inhaler 12%)Common (1% to 10%): Drowsiness, extrapyramidal reactions, akathisiaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Dizziness, faintness, staggering gait, shuffling gait, muscle twitching, weakness, insomnia, agitation, tension, seizures, akinesia, slurred speech, numbness, confusional stateFrequency not reported: Headache, lightheadedness, paresthesia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, seizures, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia
Drowsiness has been frequently reported at the beginning of therapy or when the dosage is increased.  It is generally mild and usually subsides with continued therapy.  The incidence of sedation has been reported as less than certain aliphatic phenothiazines, and more than the piperazine phenothiazines.
Rare (less than 0.1%): Bronchospasm (inhaler)Frequency not reported: Dyspnea, nasal congestion
Use of the inhaler was shown to cause bronchospasm in clinical pulmonary safety trials as measured by FEV1 and respiratory signs and symptoms.  Additionally, patients with asthma or other pulmonary diseases were shown to be at higher risk and the effect of FEV1 was greater following the second dose (administered 10 hours later).

Rare (less than 0.1%): Jaundice and/or hepatitisFrequency not reported: Hepatocellular injury
