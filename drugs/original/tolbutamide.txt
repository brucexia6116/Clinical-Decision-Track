The most commonly reported adverse reactions have included gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea, epigastric fullness, and heartburn.
In the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study, cardiovascular mortality rate was approximately 2.5 times higher in patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus tolbutamide 1.5 g per day compared with that of patients treated with diet alone.  The UGDP study was a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=823).  Tolbutamide was stopped based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality; a significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but stopping the drug may have limited the ability to measure that.
