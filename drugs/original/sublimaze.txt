The most commonly reported adverse reactions included headache, nausea, vomiting, ,dizziness, and constipation.[Ref]

Cases of seizures have occasionally been reported, but some investigators have suggested that the seizure-like events reported may have been episodes of fentanyl induced-rigidity.[Ref]
One report has suggested that epidural fentanyl (the active ingredient contained in Sublimaze) may mask the pain of myocardial ischemia in patients treated with fentanyl for other reasons.  Another report has suggested that QTc interval prolongation may occur in some patients receiving the related narcotic sufentanil.  Another report has implicated fentanyl as a potential cause of pulsus alternans in a patient with aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure.Nevertheless, fentanyl has been advocated by some as a satisfactory agent for coronary artery surgery.[Ref]
Common (1% to 10%): TachycardiaUncommon (0.1% to 1%): Sinus tachycardia, chest pain, hypertension, hypotension, palpitationsRare (less than 0.1%): Arrhythmias, cardiac arrestFrequency not reported: Syncope, vasodilation, bradycardia, bigeminy, myocardial infarctPostmarketing reports: Circulatory depression[Ref]

Approximately 60% of patients had some redness at the skin site 24-hours after removal of the iontophoretic transdermal system.  The majority of skin events were categorized as mild, erythema and papules were observed; 2 patients had hyperpigmentation at the application site lasting 2 to 3 weeks; 3 patients had a rectangular mark at the application site which persisted for up to 3 months.[Ref]

Rare (less than 0.1%): Anaphylaxis[Ref]
The hemolysis observed may have been related to rapid injection of large volumes of hypotonic fentanyl (the active ingredient contained in Sublimaze) solution.  The authors therefore recommend slower injection rates and/or mixture in isotonic fluid.[Ref]
