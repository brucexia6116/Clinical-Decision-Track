As well as its needed effects, sevoflurane (the active ingredient contained in Sojourn) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.  While you are receiving and recovering from an inhalation anesthetic like sevoflurane, your health care professional will closely follow its effects. However, some effects may not be noticed until later.
Some sevoflurane side effects may not need any medical attention. As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear. Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
