Applies to nalidixic acid: compounding powder, oral suspension, oral tablet
Frequency not reported: Allergic reactions (including rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, eosinophilia, arthralgia with joint stiffness and swelling, anaphylactoid reactions [including anaphylactic shock]), serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactoid) reactions[Ref]
Rash was reported most often.Photosensitivity reactions appeared to be related to the amount of sun exposure rather than amount of drug taken.  Most reactions were reported following intense sun exposure during the summer.  Large bullae developed most commonly on the dorsum of the hands and feet.  Photosensitivity reactions usually resolved 2 weeks to 2 months after drug discontinuation.  In some cases, bullae continued to appear with additional sun exposure or with mild skin trauma for up to 3 months after discontinuation of nalidixic acid (the active ingredient contained in NegGram)   Recurrence of bullae have been reported after 1 year.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Rash, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, photosensitivity reactions (consisting of erythema and bullae on exposed skin surfaces), phototoxicity (moderate to severe)[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea[Ref]
Brief convulsions were usually associated with excessive doses.  In general, the convulsions were reported in patients with predisposing factors such as epilepsy or cerebral atherosclerosis.[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Convulsions/seizures, sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and/or large axons (resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, weakness)Frequency not reported: Drowsiness, weakness, headache, dizziness, vertigo, peripheral neuropathy, paresthesiaInfants and children:Frequency not reported: Increased intracranial pressure with bulging anterior fontanel, papilledema, headache, 6th cranial nerve palsy[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Toxic psychosis, psychotic reactions (involving delirium, photophobia, paranoia, visual hallucinations)[Ref]
Toxic psychosis was usually associated with excessive doses.Psychotic reactions involving delirium, photophobia, paranoia, and visual hallucinations have rarely been reported with nalidixic acid.  Seizures may also be involved and hyperglycemia was often present.[Ref]
Frequency not reported: Arthralgias, myalgias, tendon disorders (including tendon rupture)[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Reversible subjective visual disturbances without objective findings (including overbrightness of lights/photophobia, change in color perception, difficulty in focusing, decrease in visual acuity, double vision)[Ref]
Visual disturbances usually resolved with dosage reduction or drug discontinuation.[Ref]
Hemolytic anemia secondary to nalidixic acid (the active ingredient contained in NegGram) most commonly occurred in patients with G6PD deficiency but was also reported in patients without this deficiency.  Direct Coombs' tests were generally positive.  Death from nalidixic acid induced hemolytic anemia has been reported.[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia (sometimes associated with glucose 6-phosphate deficiency)[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis[Ref]
Metabolic acidosis has been reported in a few patients, generally after an overdose of nalidixic acid.  Lactic acidosis resulting in death occurred in a diabetic woman.[Ref]
Rare (less than 0.1%): Cholestasis[Ref]
