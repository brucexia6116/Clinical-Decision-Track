If diarrhea occurs and it is unresponsive to discontinuation of the drug and/or standard therapy, pseudomembranous colitis should be considered.[Ref]

Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported in patients treated with cephalosporins.[Ref]
Anaphylactic reactions are rare, but may occur, especially in patients with a history of penicillin allergy.Serum-sickness-like reactions are more frequent in pediatric patients and following a second or subsequent course of cefaclor and have been characterized by erythema multiforme, rash, arthritis, and/or arthralgia with or without fever.[Ref]
Hypersensitivity reactions have included rash, morbilliform eruptions (1%), pruritus, serum-sickness-like reactions, urticaria, anaphylactic reaction, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylactoid reaction, and angioedema.[Ref]

Extended-release cefaclor has been associated with increased BUN (0.2%), and increased creatinine (0.5%).  Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with toxic nephropathy, reversible interstitial nephritis, and renal dysfunction.[Ref]
Hematologic side effects have included eosinophilia (2%), positive Coombs' test (less than 0.5%), leukopenia, thrombocytosis, transient thrombocytopenia (rare), transient lymphocytosis, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, and reversible neutropenia.  Extended-release cefaclor has been associated with increased eosinophils (0.3%), decreased erythrocyte count (0.3%), decreased hemoglobin (0.2%), decreased lymphocytes (0.3%), increased mean cell volume (0.7%), decreased segmented neutrophils (0.3%), and decreased platelet count (0.4%).  Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with hemorrhage and pancytopenia.[Ref]
Genitourinary side effects have included genital pruritus and vaginitis in less than 1% of patients.  Extended-release cefaclor has been associated with vaginitis (2.4%) and vaginal moniliasis (2.2%), and dysmenorrhea, dysuria, leukorrhea, menstrual disorder, and nocturia in 0.1% to 1% of patients.  Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with false-positive tests for urine glucose.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects have rarely included reversible hyperactivity, agitation, nervousness, insomnia, confusion, hypertonia, dizziness, hallucinations, and somnolence.  Extended release cefaclor has been associated with headache in 4.9% of patients, and dizziness, insomnia, nervousness, somnolence, and tremor in 0.1% to 1% of patients, and paresthesia and vertigo.  Some cephalosporins have been associated with seizures, primarily when dosages were not reduced in renally impaired patients.[Ref]
Other side effects associated with extended-release cefaclor have included abdominal pain (1.6%), back pain (1%), and accidental injury, chest pain, chills, ear pain, fever, flu syndrome, infection, malaise, neck pain, otitis media, pain, and surgical procedure in 0.1% to 1% of patients.  Cephalosporins as a class have been associated with abdominal pain, fever, and superinfection.[Ref]
Respiratory side effects associated with extended-release cefaclor have included rhinitis (3.9%), increased cough (1.5%), pharyngitis (1.4%), and asthma, bronchitis, lung disorder, respiratory disorder, and sinusitis in 0.1% to 1% of patients.[Ref]
Dermatologic side effects have included pruritus, maculopapular rash, rash, and urticaria.[Ref]
Musculoskeletal side effects associated with extended-release cefaclor have included arthralgia and myalgia in 0.1% to 1% of patients.[Ref]
