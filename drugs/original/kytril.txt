Nervous system side effects have been reported the most frequently.  These have included headache (up to 15% to 52.2%), dizziness (5% to 26.1%), insomnia (5%), anxiety (2%), somnolence (1%), asthenia, agitation, and stimulation.  Headache (0.7%) has been reported in patients using the granisetron (the active ingredient contained in Kytril) transdermal system.  One case compatible with, but not diagnostic of, extrapyramidal symptoms has been reported.
Granisetron-induced headache is generally mild.  In clinical trials, headache typically resolved spontaneously or was relieved by analgesics.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea (20%), constipation (3% to 50%), vomiting (12%), diarrhea (4% to 9%), abdominal pain (4% to 6%), dyspepsia (4% to 6%), flatulence, dry mouth, and taste disturbances.  Constipation (5.4%) has been reported in patients using the granisetron (the active ingredient contained in Kytril) transdermal system.
Constipation appears to be dose related.  In dose-finding studies, constipation occurred in up to 50% of patients treated with single doses of granisetron 300 mcg/kg.  If necessary, constipation may be alleviated by the use of laxatives.
Hepatic side effects have been reported rarely.  These have included elevations in serum transaminases (two times normal values).  Causality is unknown.  Acute pancreatitis has also been reported.
Cardiovascular side effects have included hypertension in 1% of patients.  Atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris, and syncope have been reported rarely.  Hypotension, sinus bradycardia, A-V block, ventricular ectopy, QT prolongation, and ECG changes have been reported as well, although causality is unknown.
Results of a review of the cardiovascular effects of the drug class 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists in the literature reported that electrocardiographic (ECG) changes were so small to be considered clinically insignificant.  ECG changes were most noticeable between 1 to 2 hours after a dose of granisetron and returned to baseline within 24 hours.  To date, no serious cardiac side effects (including torsades de pointes) triggered by  ECG interval changes have been connected with the use of 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists.
Hypersensitivity side effects have been reported rarely.  These have included skin rashes, facial flushing, anaphylactoid reactions, shortness of breath, hypotension, and urticaria.  One report suggests hypersensitivity reactions with 5-HT 3-antagonists may be a class effect and cross-reactive.
Other side effects including asthenia (5% to 18%) and fever (up to 8%) have been reported.
