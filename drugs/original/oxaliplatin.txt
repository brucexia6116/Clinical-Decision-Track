In general, side effects have been reported in 98% of patients, with 73% of those characterized as NCI CTC Grade 3/4 severity.  The incidence of side effects given in the following sections refers to oxaliplatin/fluorouracil/leucovorin combination therapy. The most common side effects include peripheral sensory neuropathies, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea. Thirteen percent of patients in the combination therapy group and 18% in the fluorouracil/leucovorin group discontinued treatment due to neuropathies, or gastrointestinal or hematologic side effects.The incidence of death was 5% in the combination therapy group, 8% in the oxaliplatin monotherapy group, and 7% in the fluorouracil/leucovorin group within 30 days of treatment (regardless of causality).[Ref]
Gastrointestinal side effects have included diarrhea (68% overall, 11% NCI CTC Grade 3/4), nausea (65% overall, 11% Grade 3/4), vomiting (40% overall, 9% Grade 3/4), stomatitis (37% overall, 3% Grade 3/4), abdominal pain (33% overall, 4% Grade 3/4), anorexia (29% overall, 3% Grade 3/4), and gastroesophageal reflux (5% overall, 2% Grade 3/4).  Side effects with less than 1% incidence of Grade 3/4 severity have included constipation (32%), dyspepsia (14%), taste perversion (13%), mucositis (7%), and flatulence (5%).  Additional side effects possibly related to treatment have been reported in 2% to 5% of patients and include dry mouth, melena, gingivitis, rectal hemorrhage, hemorrhoids, hemoptysis, proctitis, tenesmus, intestinal obstruction, and enlarged abdomen.  Postmarketing gastrointestinal side effects have included ileus, pancreatitis, colitis (including Clostridium difficile diarrhea), severe diarrhea/vomiting resulting in hypokalemia, and intestinal obstruction.[Ref]
Acute neuropathy is reversible and primarily of a peripheral sensory nature.  The onset occurs within hours to 2 days of dosing.  It generally resolves within 2 weeks and frequently recurs with repeat doses.  Exposure to cold temperature or cold objects may precipitate or exacerbate symptoms.  Symptoms may include transient paresthesia, dysesthesia, and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat.  Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and chest pressure have also been reported.  Ice should be avoided for mucositis prophylaxis.  Acute pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia with sensations of dysphagia and dyspnea but no laryngospasm or bronchospasm has been reported in 1% to 2% of patients.Persistent neuropathy generally lasts for more than 2 weeks and is also primarily of a peripheral sensory nature.  Symptoms included paresthesias, dysesthesias, hypoesthesias, and deficits in proprioception that may interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, or walking).  Persistent neuropathy may occur with no prior neuropathy event.  Eighty percent of patients who developed Grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from Grade 1 or 2.  The symptoms may improve in some patients when oxaliplatin is discontinued.Preventive measures include calcium and magnesium solutions, gabapentin, carbamazepine, amifostine, and glutathione.  Treatment measures include calcium and magnesium solutions, gabapentin, and alpha-lipoic acid.[Ref]
Nervous system side effects which have been most frequently reported include two types of neuropathy (74%) - acute and persistent, with an incidence of 56% and 48%, respectively.  Six percent of patients experienced NCI CTC Grade 3/4 persistent neuropathy.  Side effects with less than 1% incidence of Grade 3/4 severity have included headache, dizziness, and insomnia.  Additional side effects possibly related to treatment have been reported in 2% to 5% of patients and include anxiety, depression, ataxia, nervousness, and somnolence.  Postmarketing nervous system side effects include deafness, loss of deep tendon reflexes, dysarthria, Lhermitte sign, cranial nerve palsies, fasciculations, convulsions, and Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES).[Ref]
Hematologic side effects have included thrombocytopenia (68% all grades; 4% NCI CTC Grade 3/4), neutropenia (73% all grades; 44% Grade 3/4), leukopenia (76% all grades; 19% Grade 3/4), anemia (81% all grades, 2% Grade 3/4), thromboembolism (9% overall, 8% Grade 3/4), and febrile neutropenia (6% overall, 6% Grade 3/4).  Postmarketing hematologic side effects have included reports of immunoallergic thrombocytopenia, immunoallergic hemolytic anemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and prolongation of prothrombin time and of INR in patients receiving anticoagulants.  One case of fatal hemolytic anemia has been reported.[Ref]
Side effects affecting the body as a whole have included fatigue (68% overall, 7% NCI CTC Grade 3/4), fever (29% overall, 1% Grade 3/4), back pain (19% overall, 3% Grade 3/4), edema (15% overall, 1% Grade 3/4), pain (15% overall, 2% Grade 3/4), chest pain (8% overall, 1% Grade 3/4), flushing (10%), peripheral edema (10%), rigors (10%), hot flashes (2% to 5%), and angioedema.[Ref]
Respiratory side effects have included dyspnea (20% overall, 4% NCI CTC Grade 3/4) and coughing (19% overall, 1% Grade 3/4).  Side effects with a less than 1% incidence of Grade 3/4 severity have included rhinitis (15%), upper respiratory tract infection (10%), pharyngitis (9%), epistaxis (9%), and hiccup (5%).  Pulmonary fibrosis and other interstitial lung diseases (sometimes fatal) have also been reported (0.7%).  A case of cryptogenic organizing pneumonitis has been reported.[Ref]
Patients who develop mild to moderate hypersensitivity to oxaliplatin may be pretreated with steroids as well as type 1 and type 2 histamine receptor antagonists.  However, patients who develop severe reactions are unlikely to tolerate further therapy.[Ref]
Hypersensitivity reactions of an anaphylactoid and anaphylactic nature with symptoms of rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and rarely, bronchospasm, and hypotension have been reported.  Anaphylactic shock has also been reported.  Less than 1% of hypersensitivity reactions were characterized as NCI CTC Grade 3/4.  Other platinum compounds have been associated with fatal hypersensitivity reactions.  Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines have been used to manage symptoms.  Postmarketing hypersensitivity reactions have included laryngospasm.[Ref]
Hepatic side effects have included elevations in ALT (31% overall, 0% NCI CTC Grade 3/4), AST (47% overall, 0% Grade 3/4), and total bilirubin (13% overall, 1% Grade 3/4).
