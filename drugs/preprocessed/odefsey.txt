At week , the mean change from baseline in ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels was lower in the rilpivirine group (+ nmol/L) than in the efavirenz group (+ nmol/L).
Mean values for both basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol values at week  were within the normal range.
In the rilpivirine group,  of  patients with normal  mcg ACTH stimulation test at baseline developed abnormal  mcg ACTH stimulation test (peak cortisol level less than  mcg/dL) during the trial versus  of  patients in the efavirenz group.
Abnormal  mcg ACTH stimulation test at week  was seen in  of the  rilpivirine patients and  of the  efavirenz patients.
Clinical significance of abnormal  mcg ACTH stimulation tests (or the higher rate in the rilpivirine group) has not been established.
