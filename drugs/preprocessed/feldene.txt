More frequent side effects include: heartburn, nausea, and prolonged bleeding time.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking piroxicam, get emergency help immediately:
The most commonly reported adverse effects are abdominal pain/discomfort, flatulence, nausea, epigastric distress, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache.
Common ( to ): Anorexia, indigestion, abdominal pain/discomfort, constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, flatulence, gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, nausea, gastric and duodenal ulcers, vomiting, epigastric distress Uncommon ( to ): Dry mouth, esophagitis, gastritis, glossitis, hematemesis, melena, rectal bleeding, stomatitisRare ( to ): Colic, eructation, pancreatitis	Frequency not reported: Peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal hemorrhage
Evidence from observational studies have shown administration of doses greater than  mg orally per day increases the risk for gastrointestinal (GI) side effects.
This drug may be associated with a high risk of GI toxicity relative to other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
About  in  patients who develop serious upper GI adverse events due to NSAID therapy are symptomatic.
Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in approximately  of patients whom are treated for  to  months and in  to  of patients treated for  year.
Common ( to ): Abnormal renal function Uncommon ( to ): Renal papillary necrosis, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, renal failure
Renal toxicity while using piroxicam has occurred in patients in whom renal prostaglandins have a compensatory role in the maintenance of renal perfusion.
In these patients, administration of NSAIDs may cause a dose dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and secondarily, renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.
Common ( to ): Elevated liver enzymesUncommon ( to ): Hepatitis, jaundiceRare ( to ): Liver failure
Significant elevations of the liver enzymes AST and ALT (about  or more times the upper limit of normal) have occurred in approximately  of patients in clinical trials with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
Borderline elevations have occurred in up to  of patients taking NSAIDs, including this drug.
Common ( to ): EdemaUncommon ( to ): Congestive heart failure, hypertension, tachycardia, syncopeRare ( to ): Arrhythmia, exacerbation of angina, hypotension, myocardial infarction, palpitations, vasculitis, chest pain 	Frequency not reported: Arterial thrombotic events
Clinical trials of several COX- selective and nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of up to  years duration have shown an increased risk of serious and sometimes fatal cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
Observational studies suggest that piroxicam (the active ingredient contained in Feldene) may be associated with a higher risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions than other non-oxicam NSAIDs.
There is an increased risk early in the course of therapy, with the majority of cases occurring within the first month.
Common ( to ): Pruritus, rashUncommon ( to ): Alopecia, bruising, desquamation, erythema, photosensitivity, Rare ( to ): Toxic epidermal necrosis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, onycholysis, Stevens - Johnson syndrome, urticaria, vesiculobullous reaction, ecchymosis, petechial rashFrequency not reported: Non-thrombocytopenic purpura (Henoch-Schonlein)
Common ( to ): Anemia, prolonged bleeding timeUncommon ( to ): Eosinophilia, leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopeniaRare ( to ): Agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia	Frequency not reported: Decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit
A combination of dermatological/allergic signs and symptoms suggestive of serum sickness have occasionally occurred while using this drug.
These include arthralgias, pruritus, fever, fatigue and rash (, vesiculobullous reactions and exfoliative dermatitis).
Rare ( to ): Anaphylaxis, angioedemaFrequency not reported: Serum sickness
Common ( to ): Elevated BUN, elevated serum creatinine, anorexiaUncommon ( to ): Weight changes, hyperkalemia, fluid retentionRare ( to ): Appetite changes, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia
Common ( to ): Dizziness, headache, sedationUncommon ( to ): Asthenia, drowsiness, malaise, paresthesia, somnolence, tremors, vertigo, amnesiaRare ( to ): Akathisia, convulsions, coma, meningitisPostmarketing experience: Aseptic meningitis
Uncommon ( to ): Asthma, dyspnea, epistaxis Rare ( to ): Respiratory depression, pneumonia	Frequency not reported: Bronchospasm
Common ( to ): Tinnitus, deafnessUncommon ( to ): FeverRare ( to ): Death, hearing impairment, thirst
Rare ( to ): Female fertility decreased
Uncommon ( to ): Infections, sepsisRare ( to ): Positive ANA, flu-like syndrome
Uncommon ( to ): Cystitis, dysuria, hematuria, oliguria, polyuria, proteinuria, urinary frequency, menorrhagia
Rare ( to ): Sweating
Uncommon ( to ): Blurred visionRare ( to ): Conjunctivitis, swollen eyes
