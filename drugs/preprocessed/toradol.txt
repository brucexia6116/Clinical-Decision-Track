As well as its needed effects, ketorolac (the active ingredient contained in Toradol) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some ketorolac side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most common adverse reactions among patients treated with ketorolac (the active ingredient contained in Toradol) include abdominal pain, nausea, dyspepsia, and headaches.
For patients receiving the nasal spray, nasal discomfort, rhinalgia, increased lacrimation, throat irritation, and rhinitis were reported.
A large postmarketing observational study (n=,) revealed the incidence of clinically serious gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding was dose dependent and more than double in patients  years or older.
The incidence of clinically serious GI bleeding after up to  days of treatment with doses of  mg or less, greater than  to  mg, greater than  to  mg, or greater than  mg, respectively was , , , and  in those less than  years compared with , , , and  in those  years or older.
Among patients with a history of GI perforation, ulcer, or bleeding, these numbers were , , , and  compared with , , , and , in younger and older patients, respectively.
Very common ( or more): Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nauseaCommon ( to ): Constipation, diarrhea, flatulence, gastrointestinal (GI) fullness, GI ulcers (gastric/duodenal), gross bleeding/perforation, heartburn, stomatitis, vomiting, throat irritation (nasal spray) Frequency not reported: Anorexia, dry mouth, eructation, esophagitis, excessive thirst, gastritis, glossitis, hematemesis, melena, rectal bleeding, increased appetite, peptic ulcers, ulcers, hematemesis, gastritisPostmarketing reports: Acute pancreatitis, liver failure, ulcerative stomatitis, exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), eructation
Common ( to ): Anemia, increased bleeding timeFrequency not reported: Bleeding, hematoma, postoperative wound hemorrhagePostmarketing reports: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia purpura, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, postoperative wound hemorrhage (rarely requiring blood transfusion)
Serious events of bleeding (n=) or hematoma (n=) at the operative site were reported in controlled clinical trials in patients (n=) undergoing major surgeries (primarily knee and hip replacements, and abdominal hysterectomies) receiving ketorolac nasal spray compared with  patient in the placebo group (hematoma).
In pediatric patients, an increased risk of bleeding was observed following tonsillectomy.
In a retrospective analysis, risk of bleeding following a tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy was  in patients receiving this drug compared with  in those receiving opioids.
The postoperative hemorrhage rate in patients  years and younger was  with ketorolac treatment versus  without.
In a prospective study in patients  to  years undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy, the overall incidence of bleeding in patients receiving this drug was  compared with  in children receiving morphine.
However, during the first  hours after surgery, bleeding was observed in  of the ketorolac group versus  of the morphine group.
Common ( to ): Edema, hypertension, bradycardiaFrequency not reported: Congestive heart failure, palpitations, pallor, tachycardia, syncope, cardiac failurePostmarketing reports: Arrhythmia, chest pain, flushing, hypotension, myocardial infarction, vasculitis
Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase (COX)- selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to  years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.
All NSAIDs appear to have a similar risk.
There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates this increased risk and may be associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal events.
Common ( to ): Rash, pruritus, purpura, sweatingVery rare (less than ):Frequency not reported: Alopecia, photosensitivity, urticariaPostmarketing reports: Angioedema, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Lyell's syndrome, bullous reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis
Frequency not reported: Anaphylactoid reactionsPostmarketing reports: Laryngeal edema, tongue edema
Common ( to ): Abnormal renal function, oliguriaPostmarketing reports: Acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome
Common ( to ): Elevated liver enzymesFrequency not reported: Hepatitis, jaundice, liver failure
