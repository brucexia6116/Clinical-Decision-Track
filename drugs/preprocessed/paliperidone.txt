As well as its needed effects, paliperidone may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.

If any of the following side effects occur while taking paliperidone, check with your doctor immediately:
Some paliperidone side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:

In a QT study evaluating the effect of immediate-release oral paliperidone 8 mg (n=50), a mean placebo-subtracted increase from baseline on day 8 at 1.
5 hours postdose was 12.
3 milliseconds (ms).
The mean steady-state peak plasma concentration achieved with immediate-release paliperidone was determined to be more than twice the exposure expected with the recommended 12 mg dose.
None of the subjects had a QTc interval exceeding 60 ms.
According to the phase 3 safety database which included double-blind and open-label extension studies (n=2054), 2 patients experienced QTc interval prolongation greater than 500 ms.
In placebo controlled trials with oral paliperidone, orthostatic hypotension increased with increasing doses, primarily at the 12 mg per day dose.

Paliperidone has a prolactin-elevating effect similar to that seen with risperidone.
Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic drugs.
Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion and in turn inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis.
Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds.
