Other dosage forms:
As well as its needed effects, paliperidone may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking paliperidone, check with your doctor immediately:
Some paliperidone side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Very common ( or more): Tachycardia (up to ) Common ( to ): Atrioventricular block first degree, bundle branch block, sinus arrhythmia, bradycardia, hypertension, conduction disorder, ECG QT prolongation, orthostatic hypotensionUncommon ( to ): Atrial fibrillation, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, abnormal ECG, palpitations, hypotension Rare (less than ): FlushingFrequency not reported: QTc interval prolongation, edema Postmarketing reports: Ischemia, venous thrombosis
In a QT study evaluating the effect of immediate-release oral paliperidone  mg (n=), a mean placebo-subtracted increase from baseline on day  at  hours postdose was  milliseconds (ms).
The mean steady-state peak plasma concentration achieved with immediate-release paliperidone was determined to be more than twice the exposure expected with the recommended  mg dose.
None of the subjects had a QTc interval exceeding  ms.
According to the phase  safety database which included double-blind and open-label extension studies (n=),  patients experienced QTc interval prolongation greater than  ms.
In placebo controlled trials with oral paliperidone, orthostatic hypotension increased with increasing doses, primarily at the  mg per day dose.

Extrapyramidal symptoms included oculogyric crisis, muscle rigidity, musculoskeletal stiffness, nuchal rigidity, torticollis, trismus, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dyskinesia, dystonia, extrapyramidal disorder, hypertonia, hypokinesia, involuntary muscle contractions, parkinsonism gait, parkinsonism, tremor, and restlessness.
Somnolence includes the terms somnolence, sedation, and hypersomnia.
Based on pooled data from -week fixed dose studies, the following nervous system adverse events appear to be dose-related: akathisia, dystonia, extrapyramidal disorder, hypertonia, and parkinsonism.
The increased incidence occurred primarily at the  mg dose, although in some cases, also the  mg dose.
Very common ( or more): Insomnia (up to )Common ( to ): Agitation, anxiety, sleep disorder, nightmare, mania, depression, suicidal ideationUncommon ( to ): Confusional state, decreased libido, anorgasmia, nervousness Frequency not reported: Restlessness Postmarketing reports: Blunted affect

The most commonly reported adverse reactions included extrapyramidal symptoms, tachycardia, akathisia, somnolence, tremor, dystonia, cogwheel rigidity, anxiety, weight increased, dyspepsia, constipation, nasopharyngitis, and injection site reactions with the injectable product.
Common ( to ): Weight increased, weight decreased, decreased appetite, increased appetiteUncommon ( to ): Diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, anorexia, increased triglyceridesRare (less than ): Water intoxication, hypoglycemia, polydipsia, increased cholesterolFrequency not reported: Hyperinsulinemia Postmarketing reports: Diabetic ketoacidosis

Rare (less than ): HypersensitivityPostmarketing reports: Anaphylactic reaction
There have been postmarketing reports of anaphylactic reaction in patients receiving long-acting injection who had previously tolerated oral risperidone or oral paliperidone.
Common ( to ): Galactorrhea, gynecomastiaRare (less than ): Hyperprolactinemia, breast engorgement, breast dischargeFrequency not reported: Breast discharge, elevated serum prolactin, breast discomfortPostmarketing reports: Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
Paliperidone has a prolactin-elevating effect similar to that seen with risperidone.
Risperidone is associated with higher levels of prolactin elevation than other antipsychotic drugs.
Hyperprolactinemia may suppress hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) resulting in reduced pituitary gonadotropin secretion and in turn inhibit reproductive function by impairing gonadal steroidogenesis.
Galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported in patients receiving prolactin-elevating compounds.

Redness and swelling were observed in  or less of patients receiving the -month IM extended-release suspension.
Residual injection pain peaked  or  hours after injection and trended downward  days after the injection.
Deltoid injections were numerically more painful than gluteal injections.
