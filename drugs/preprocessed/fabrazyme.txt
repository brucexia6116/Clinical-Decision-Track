During clinical trials,  of  adult patients and  of  pediatric patients developed antidrug IgG antibodies; the majority of patients developed antibodies within the first  months of exposure.
In pediatric patients, IgG seroconversion in pediatric patients was attributed to prolonged half-life, which was likely due to the ability of antibodies to act as carriers for their antigens.
The clinical significance of binding and/or inhibitory antibodies to this drug is unknown.
Testing for IgE antibodies occurred in about  patients during clinical trials who experienced moderate to severe infusion reactions or in whom mast cell activation was suspected.
Of the  patients tested,  tested positive for antidrug IgE antibodies or had a positive skin test specific to this drug.
