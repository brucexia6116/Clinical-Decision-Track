Gastrointestinal side effects have included severe nausea (31%) and vomiting (11%) at the recommended doses of apomorphine.
In clinical trials conducted in the USA, patients were treated with trimethobenzamide for 3 days prior to initiation of treatment with apomorphine, and were directed to continue it for at least 6 weeks.
The number of patients stopping apomorphine treatment due to nausea was 3% and due to vomiting was 2%.
Cardiovascular side effects have included syncope (2%).
QT and QTc prolongation have been reported in very rare cases.
Apomorphine may cause dose-related decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Severe orthostatic hypotension, hypotension and/or syncope that resulted in drug withdrawal have been reported in less than 1% of patients in clinical trials.
Psychiatric side effects have included hallucinations (14%), confusion, paranoid ideation, delusions, disorientation, aggressive behavior, agitation, and delirium.
Slowing down of cognitive performance has been reported after apomorphine use in a small number of patients with Parkinson's disease.
The mechanism of action is not fully understood.
Other side effects have included falling asleep during activities of daily living.
There have been reports in the literature of patients suddenly falling asleep without prior warning, soon after receiving apomorphine subcutaneous injections.
Local side effects have included reactions at the injection site, such as bruising (16%), granuloma (4%), and pruritus (2%).
Drug abuse and dependence have been reported rarely by patients with Parkinson's disease.
These cases are characterized by frequent dosing leading to hallucinations, dyskinesia, and abnormal behavior.
Nervous system side effects have included symptoms resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with the rapid dose reduction, withdrawal of, or changes in antiparkinsonian therapy.
Migraine attacks have been reported to occur following injection of apomorphine in two postmenopausal women who had experienced migraines before menopause several years earlier.
