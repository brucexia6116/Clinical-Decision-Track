In the clinical setting of severe burns, it is difficult to distinguish between an adverse reaction to this drug and burn sequelae.
In a clinical study in pediatric patients with acute burns requiring autografts who received this drug in addition to double antibiotic solution (DAB) wound therapy (neomycin sulfate 40 mg and polymyxin B 200,000 units/liter), the incidence of rash (4.
6%) and itching (2.
8%) in the group who received this drug was not different from that experienced with DAB dressings alone (5.
7% and 1.
3%, respectively).
