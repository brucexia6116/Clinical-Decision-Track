In phase  complicated skin and skin structure infection trials, this drug was discontinued in  of patients due to a side effect, while comparator was discontinued in  of patients.
In the Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, this drug was discontinued in  of patients due to a side effect, while comparator was discontinued in  of patients.
In phase  community-acquired pneumonia trials, the death rate and rates of serious cardiorespiratory side effects were higher with this drug than comparator due to lack of therapeutic efficacy.
In clinical studies,  of patients had symptoms of muscle pain or weakness associated with CPK elevations to greater than  x ULN.
After discontinuation of this drug, CPK returned to normal within  to  days and symptoms resolved within  days.
A -year-old female with refractory acute myeloid leukemia was admitted to the blood and marrow transplant unit for a second attempt to induce remission with myeloablative chemotherapy of high-dose cytarabine.
Two months prior, the patient's first course of induction therapy was complicated by neutropenic fever and vancomycin- resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) bacteremia that was treated with linezolid for  days.
The patient was also receiving aztreonam, levofloxacin, acyclovir, amphotericin B lipid complex, and azithromycin.
Once her clinical status stabilized, she was transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) back to the blood and marrow transplant unit.
After receiving  of  scheduled doses of cytarabine, the patient required readmission to the medical ICU due to a decrease in mental status, supraventricular tachycardia, and hypotension.
Cultures of blood and urine samples at the time of her transfer showed VRE with intermediate resistance to linezolid.
The patient, who was neutropenic at this time, was started on IV daptomycin  mg ( mg/kg) every  hours.
The patient's baseline CPK was  units/L and serum creatinine level was  mg/dL.
Over the following  days, the patient's CPK level gradually increased, and on day  of daptomycin therapy, her CPK level was  units/L, BUN was  mg/dL, and serum creatinine level was  mg/dL.
To evaluate for rhabdomyolysis, urine myoglobin was measured and reported at , ng/mL.
Rhabdomyolysis was diagnosed based on increased CPK and urine myoglobin level in a patient with acute renal failure.
Daptomycin was discontinued and the patient was started on treatment for rhabdomyolysis.
Despite aggressive hydration and diuresis, CPK and urine myoglobin levels continued to increase up to  units/L and , ng/mL, respectively.
Over  weeks, the patient's CPK and urine myoglobin levels slowly resolved.
The final CPK and urine myoglobin levels measured were  units/L and  ng/mL, respectively.
In another case, a -year-old African-American female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease was admitted to the hospital and an MRI revealed L-S discitis and osteomyelitis.
After an -week course of empirical antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and levofloxacin, an open biopsy was performed.
Specimens from the biopsy cultured positive for Torulopsis glabrata, VRE, and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and the patient was started on daptomycin  mg ( mg/kg) IV as a single daily dose and voriconazole  mg twice daily.
Ten days after starting this drug, the patient developed generalized muscular weakness that progressed to the point she was unable to get out of bed.
The patient then developed nonoliguric acute renal failure with a serum creatinine of  mg/mL up from baseline of  mg/mL.
A CPK level drawn was elevated to , units/L and was associated with elevated levels: AST  units/L, ALT  units/L, and LDH  units/L.
Urinalysis was positive for hemoglobin, myoglobin, and RBCs which conferred a diagnosis of acute renal failure secondary to drug-induced rhabdomyolysis.
After this drug was discontinued and IV fluid was administered to alkalinize the urine, renal function, CPK, and liver function tests returned to baseline as well as dissipation of muscular weakness.
Myoglobin, hemoglobin, and RBCs disappeared from urine as well.
In another similar case, a -year-old male with a history hepatitis C, IV drug abuse, idiopathic thrombocytopenia, and hyperlipidemia was admitted to the hospital and an MRI revealed findings compatible with L-L discitis and osteomyelitis.
He was started on vancomycin but it was discontinued after a rash developed.
Daptomycin was started at  mg ( mg/kg) IV as a single daily dose.
The patient was also on simvastatin; however, it was discontinued prior to starting this drug.
After  days of therapy, the patient developed generalized muscle weakness progressing to the point where he was unable to get out of bed.
The patient's CPK rose to , units/L from a baseline of  units/L.
AST  units/L and ALT  units/L were elevated from baseline and alkaline phosphatase was elevated to  units/L.
This drug was discontinued and the patient was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and hydration.
The patient slowly improved and recovered all muscle strength and within  weeks his enzymes returned to baseline.
