More frequently reported side effects include: eosinophilia and leukocytosis.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking aminosalicylic acid, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported the most frequently.
These have included nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
The incidence of gastrointestinal side effects is reduced with lower doses (8 g daily) and with the granular formulation of the drug.
Hypersensitivity side effects have been reported rarely.
The first signs have included rash, often followed by fever, and much less frequently, anorexia, nausea or diarrhea.
The drug has been restarted in small but gradually increasing doses under a closely followed desensitization protocol.
Patients should be closely monitored during the first three months of therapy and treatment must be discontinued immediately at the first signs of rash, fever, jaundice, or other sign of intolerance.
Hepatic side effects have included jaundice and hepatitis.
In patients diagnosed with hepatitis, hepatomegaly was invariably present with lymphadenopathy (45%), leukocytosis (79%), and eosinophilia (55%).
Prompt recognition of symptoms with discontinuation of therapy led to recovery.
Failure to recognize symptoms of liver injury can result in a mortality of up to 21%.
A reduction in thyroxine synthesis has been associated with the administration of the sodium salt of aminosalicylic acid.
The development of goiter can be prevented by the administration of thyroxine but not iodide.
Endocrine side effects have included hypothyroidism, especially with prolonged administration.
It may be accompanied by goiter development.
Hematologic side effects have included leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia, and reduction in prothrombin.
