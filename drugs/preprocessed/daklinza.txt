In clinical trials, this drug was used in combination with sofosbuvir (with or without ribavirin), with peginterferon alfa/ribavirin, with asunaprevir, or with asunaprevir/peginterferon alfa/ribavirin.
Fatigue, headache, and nausea were reported most often when used with sofosbuvir.
Fatigue, headache, pruritus, insomnia, influenza-like illness, dry skin, nausea, decreased appetite, alopecia, rash, asthenia, irritability, myalgia, anemia, pyrexia, cough, dyspnea, neutropenia, diarrhea, and arthralgia were reported most often when used with peginterferon alfa/ribavirin; the most common side effects of at least grade 3 severity were neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia.
The side effects and laboratory abnormalities reported with this drug in combination with peginterferon alfa/ribavirin was similar to those reported with peginterferon alfa/ribavirin alone, including in patients with cirrhosis.
Headache, fatigue, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and nausea were reported most often when used with asunaprevir.
Fatigue, headache, pruritus, asthenia, influenza-like illness, insomnia, rash, anemia, cough, dry skin, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, irritability, pyrexia, and myalgia were reported most often when used with asunaprevir/peginterferon alfa/ribavirin.
