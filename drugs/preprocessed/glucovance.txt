Common side effects of Glucovance include: diarrhea.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions include hypoglycemia, upper respiratory infection, gastrointestinal events, and dizziness.
In clinical trials, all hypoglycemic episodes were managed by patients, no episodes required medical intervention or pharmacologic therapy.
The incidence of hypoglycemia was highest in patients with a baseline HbA1c less than 7%.
For patients with a baseline HbA1c between 8% and 11% receiving glyburide 2.
5 mg-metformin 500 mg as initial therapy, the frequency of hypoglycemic symptoms was 30% to 35%.
As second-line therapy in patients inadequately controlled on a sulfonylurea alone, 6.
8% of patients experienced hypoglycemic episodes.
The addition of rosiglitazone resulted in 22% of patients reporting a fingerstick glucose measurement of 50 mg/DL or lower (compared to 3.
3% of placebo patients).
Additionally in rosiglitazone-treated patients, a mean weight gain of 3 kg was observed.
Metabolic side effects, including lactic acidosis, which is a potentially fatal metabolic complication of biguanide therapy, has been reported in patients receiving metformin.
The incidence of lactic acidosis has been about 0.
03 cases per 1,000 patient years with approximately 0.
015 fatal cases per 1,000 patient-years.
The risk of lactic acidosis is particularly high in patients with underlying renal insufficiency.
Cases of lactic acidosis occurring in patients with normal renal function have been rarely reported.
Concomitant cardiovascular or liver disease, sepsis, and hypoxia may also increase the risk of lactic acidosis.

The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) side effects including diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal pain in the initial therapy trials were 31.
6% (50/158) and 38.
3% (n=62/162) in the glyburide 1.
25 mg-metformin 250 mg and the glyburide 2.
5 mg-metformin 500 mg groups, respectively.
Across all trials, GI symptoms were the most common adverse event and were more frequent at higher dose levels; less than 2% of patients discontinued therapy due to GI adverse events.
