General effects of epirubicin when used in combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fluorouracil have been reported to include lethargy (up to ) and fever (up to ).

One large retrospective study reported a significantly increased risk of CHF in patients who received cumulative doses greater than  mg/m  The study also found that previous irradiation against the heart leads to an increased risk of developing CHF with an accelerated course to death.
This indicates an additive cardiotoxic effect with the use of irradiation and epirubicin.
