In , a number of people who received the swine flu influenza vaccine developed Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS), which is a disease that may cause paralysis.
Most of these people were over  years of age.
Although only  out of every one million people who received the vaccine actually developed GBS, this number was  times higher than would normally have been expected.
Most of the people who got GBS recovered completely.
It is assumed that the swine flu virus included in the  vaccine caused the problem, but this has not been proven.
Since that time, the swine flu virus has not been used in influenza vaccines, and there has been no recurrence of GBS that was associated with influenza vaccinations.
The most common adverse events were nasal congestion, headache, sore throat, and tiredness.
