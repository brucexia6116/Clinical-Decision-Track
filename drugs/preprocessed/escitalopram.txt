Commonly reported side effects of escitalopram include: diarrhea, drowsiness, ejaculatory disorder, headache, insomnia, nausea, and delayed ejaculation.
Other side effects include: anorgasmia, constipation, dizziness, dyspepsia, fatigue, decreased libido, diaphoresis, and xerostomia.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Side effects have been reported to be generally mild and transient.
They are most common during the first  weeks of treatment and decrease in intensity and frequency with continued treatment.
They generally do not lead to treatment cessation.
The overall incidence of rates of side effects in trials with patients treated with escitalopram  mg per day  was similar to placebo-treated patients ; the incidence rate in the group treated with escitalopram  mg per day was greater .
Common side effects that occurred in the  mg per day group with an incidence approximately twice that of the  mg group and approximately twice that of the placebo group included insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, increased sweating, constipation, fatigue, and indigestion.
Antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.
An increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged  to  years) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders has been reported with short-term use of antidepressant drugs.
Adult and pediatric patients receiving antidepressants for MDD, as well as for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric indications, have reported symptoms that may be precursors to emerging suicidality, including anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania.
Causality has not been established.

Convulsions (including grand mal convulsions) have been reported with racemic citalopram.
Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs as monotherapy, but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs and drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin.
Serotonin syndrome has been reported with racemic citalopram.
At least one case of escitalopram-induced paroxysmal dystonia has been reported in the literature.
A -year-old woman developed paroxysmal cervical-cranial dystonia after receiving several days of treatment with escitalopram.
The paroxysmal movement disorders were characterized by cervical and oral contracture with sustained and painful laterocollis and twisting tongue movements.
The episodes occurred several times a day lasting for several minutes and would resolve spontaneously.
The day after escitalopram was discontinued, the paroxysmal symptoms resolved without recurrence.

Cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias reported in postmarketing experience were predominantly in females, with hypokalemia, or with pre-existing QT interval prolongation or other cardiac diseases.
Postural hypotension has been reported with other SSRIs.

Numerous cases of hyponatremia have been reported following treatment with an SSRI.
Risk factors for the development of SSRI- associated hyponatremia including advanced age, female gender, concomitant use of diuretics, low body weight, and lower baseline serum sodium levels have been identified.
Hyponatremia tends to develop within the first few weeks of treatment (range  to  days) and typically resolves within  weeks (range  hours to  weeks) after therapy has been discontinued with some patients requiring treatment.
The proposed mechanism for the development of hyponatremia involves SIADH via release of antidiuretic hormone.
A -year-old woman developed hyponatremia approximately - weeks after initiating treatment with escitalopram.
Following discontinuation of the drug and administration of intravenous normal saline solution, the patient's serum sodium and serum and urine osmolality returned to normal levels.
In a similar case, hyponatremia developed in a -year-old woman five days after initiating treatment with escitalopram.
Following discontinuation of escitalopram serum sodium levels returned to normal values over a period of  days.
The authors suggest that the risk of hyponatremia is highest during the initial weeks of treatment and is higher in women than in men, in patients  years of age or older, and in patients receiving multiple drugs that may also cause hyponatremia.
