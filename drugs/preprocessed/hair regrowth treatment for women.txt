Minoxidil topical (the active ingredient contained in Hair Regrowth Treatment for Women) is generally well tolerated.
Dermatological adverse events are the only side effects reported more commonly as compared to placebo.
Edema, salt and water retention, pericardial effusion, pericarditis, tamponade, tachycardia, and angina have been reported with oral minoxidil.
Patients with underlying heart disease may be at increased risk for these or other cardiovascular adverse effects.
Rarely, cardiovascular side effects have included edema, chest pain, blood pressure changes, palpitations, and changes in pulse rate with minoxidil topical therapy.
Despite low levels of systemic absorption, in one study of  men using either topical minoxidil  twice a day or placebo for  months, minoxidil was associated with cardiac changes, such as significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic volume, cardiac output, and left ventricular mass.
Systemic side effects are uncommon since very little minoxidil is absorbed after topical application.
In one study, the serum levels after  mg twice a day oral versus  twice a day topical minoxidil were  and  ng per mL, respectively.
Exacerbation of hair loss/alopecia has been reported.
