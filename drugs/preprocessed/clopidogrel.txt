The most commonly reported adverse effect was bleeding, including life threatening and fatal bleeding.
In the COMMIT study (n=,), the incidence of major non-cerebral or cerebral bleeding was  in clopidogrel plus aspirin treated patients, with  classified as major non-cerebral ( fatal) and  as hemorrhagic stroke ( fatal).
Non-major noncerebral bleeding or any noncerebral bleeding occurred in  and  of patients receiving this drug plus aspirin, respectively.
Major bleeds were defined as cerebral bleeds or non-cerebral bleeds thought to have caused death or that required transfusion.
In the CURE study (n=,), the incidence of fatal bleeding  and intracranial hemorrhage  was the same between clopidogrel with aspirin and placebo with aspirin groups.

In CURE (n=,),  treated with clopidogrel and aspirin compared to  placebo, as well as  of patients in CLARITY (n=) reported a rash.
Drug discontinuation due to skin disorders in CAPRIE was  and in CURE  of patients.
