If any of the following side effects occur while taking colestipol, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
Gastrointestinal side effects occur in the majority of patients.
In one study, up to 68% of patients complained of gastrointestinal side effects.
Constipation is most common and can be severe.
Intestinal obstruction is reported with another bile acid sequestrant; elderly and pediatric patients treated with colestipol may be at risk for this as well.
Increases in fluid intake as well as dietary fiber may help to reduce the severity of constipation.
In general, gastrointestinal side effects tend to diminish with continued therapy.
If gastrointestinal side effects are significant, dosage reduction, even if temporary, may be beneficial.
Gastrointestinal side effects include constipation (10 to 28%), heartburn (17%), abdominal discomfort (11%), nausea (9%), belching, flatulence, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Peptic ulceration, gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding, cholecystitis, cholelithiasis, and anorexia have been reported rarely.
Hematologic side effects include a single report of prolonged prothrombin time responsive to vitamin K supplementation.
Hepatic side effects include transient elevations in serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase.
Nervous system side effects include headache, dizziness, and, very rarely, anxiety, vertigo, and drowsiness.
Hypersensitivity reactions have included urticaria and dermatitis.
Musculoskeletal side effects include rare reports of muscle pain, joint pain, and arthritis.
Metabolic side effects include increases in serum phosphorus and chloride and decreases in serum sodium and potassium.
Colestipol has been reported to decrease the absorption of thyroxine (T4).
