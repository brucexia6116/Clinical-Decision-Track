If any of the following side effects occur while taking irinotecan, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
"Early" diarrhea usually occurs during or shortly after dosage administration.
It may appear as a component of early cholinergic syndrome and may be preceded by complaints of diaphoresis and abdominal cramping.
Symptoms may usually be quickly ameliorated by atropine.
Late diarrhea can be prolonged, may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance and can be life threatening.
Late diarrhea should be treated promptly with aggressive high dose loperamide therapy.
The patient may be treated with  mg at the first loose stool or increase in frequency of bowel movements and every  hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for  hours.
Patients with severe diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated.
Administration of irinotecan (the active ingredient contained in Camptosar) should be interrupted if severe diarrhea occurs and the dose may need to be reduced.
Ulcerative and ischemic colitis can be complicated by ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection, including typhlitis.
Patients experiencing ileus should receive prompt antibiotic support.
Gastrointestinal side effects including "early" diarrhea occurring within  hours of the administration of irinotecan  and "late" diarrhea occurring over  hours after dosage administration  have been reported.
Nausea , vomiting , anorexia , constipation , flatulence , stomatitis  and dyspepsia  have also been reported.
Cases of ulcerative and ischemic colitis have been reported infrequently.
Intestinal perforation, symptomatic pancreatitis, and asymptomatic elevated pancreatic enzymes have also been reported rarely.
Cases of megacolon have been reported in post-marketing experience.
Hematologic side effects including leukopenia , anemia  and neutropenia  have been reported.
Reduction in neutrophils has been the predominant clinically relevant hematologic effect.
The median time to nadir for hematologic values ranges from  days for platelets to  days for hemoglobin, neutrophils and leukocytes.
The median time to nadir for platelets has been reported to have decreased as the starting dose increased.
General side effects including asthenia , abdominal cramping/pain , fever , pain , headache , back pain , chills , minor infections , edema  and abdominal enlargement  have been reported.
Hiccups have been reported in post-marketing experience.
Minor infections consisted primarily of upper respiratory infections.
Metabolic side effects including loss of body weight , dehydration , increased alkaline phosphatase , and increased SGOT  have been reported.
Rare cases of hyponatremia (mostly related with diarrhea and vomiting) have also been reported.
Dermatologic side effects including alopecia , sweating , rash , and paresthesias have been reported.
A case of skin toxicity has also been reported.
Interstitial pulmonary disease can be fatal.
Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors.
Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during irinotecan (the active ingredient contained in Camptosar) therapy.
Respiratory side effects including dyspnea , increased coughing  and rhinitis  have been reported.
Interstitial pulmonary disease presenting as pulmonary infiltrates has been uncommon during irinotecan therapy.
A case of interstitial pneumonia has also been reported.
Neurologic side effects including insomnia  and dizziness  have been reported.
Cardiovascular side effects including vasodilation  have been reported.
Myocardial ischemic events have been observed following irinotecan (the active ingredient contained in Camptosar) therapy in post-marketing experience.
Hepatic side effects including elevation of hepatic transaminases  have been reported.
Transient increase of amylase and occasionally transient increase of lipase have been reported in post-marketing experience.
Other side effects including a case of dysarthria have been reported.
Hypersensitivity side effects including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been reported.
Renal side effects have been reported.
Infrequent cases of renal insufficiency including acute renal failure, hypotension, or circulatory failure have been observed in patients who experienced episodes of dehydration associated with sepsis, diarrhea, and/or vomiting.
Musculoskeletal side effects including muscular contractions and cramps have been reported.
