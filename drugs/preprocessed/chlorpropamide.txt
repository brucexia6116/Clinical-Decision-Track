Sulfonylureas: Frequency not reported: Increased cardiovascular mortality
In the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP) study, cardiovascular mortality rate was approximately  times higher in patients treated for  to  years with diet plus tolbutamide  g per day compared with that of patients treated with diet alone.
The UGDP study was a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with type  diabetes mellitus (n=).
Tolbutamide was stopped based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality; a significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but stopping the drug may have limited the ability to measure that.
In view of the close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure among sulfonylureas, these results may apply to other drug in this class.
