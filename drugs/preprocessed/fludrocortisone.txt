Cardiovascular side effects have included hypertension, edema, cardiac enlargement, and congestive heart failure.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, and peptic ulcer disease.
Pancreatitis, ulcerative esophagitis, gastrointestinal perforation and hemorrhage also have been reported.
Corticosteroids may induce glucose intolerance by reducing the utilization of glucose in tissues and increasing hepatic glucose output.
Diabetes mellitus requiring diet modifications and hypoglycemic agents has developed in some patients.
Adrenal suppression can persist for twelve months or longer following long-term corticosteroid therapy.
Endocrine side effects have included decreased glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia resulting in diabetes-like symptoms and/or increased requirements of hypoglycemic agents in diabetics.
Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity has been suppressed for  months or longer following long-term fludrocortisone administration.
Cushingoid appearance has been a common occurrence with chronic therapy and hirsutism or virilism, impotence, and menstrual irregularities have occurred.
Metabolic side effects have included significant sodium retention, hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.
Other side effects  have included hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and negative nitrogen balance due to increased protein catabolism.
Immunologic side effects have included impairment in cell-mediated immunity and increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections.
Immune responses to skin tests have been suppressed.
Corticosteroid myopathy presenting as weakness and wasting of the proximal limb and girdle muscles has occurred.
Symptoms resolved following cessation of therapy.
Corticosteroids inhibit intestinal absorption and increase urinary excretion of calcium leading to bone resorption and bone loss.
Musculoskeletal side effects have included myopathy, osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, tendon rupture (particularly the Achilles tendon), pathologic fracture of long bones, and aseptic necrosis of bone.
Aseptic necrosis has been reported to most often affect the femoral head.
Ocular side effects have included increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and posterior subcapsular cataracts.
Psychiatric side effects have included psychoses, personality or behavioral changes, and pseudotumor cerebri.
Dermatologic side effects have included bruising, ecchymosis, petechiae, striae, delayed/impaired wound healing, acne, hirsutism, and hyperpigmentation of the skin and nails.
Hematologic side effects have included platelet alterations resulting in thrombolic events, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia.
Hepatic side effects have included reversible increases in serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase concentrations.
Other side effects have included a glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (not related to adrenal insufficiency) following abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroid.
Pseudorheumatism, or glucocorticoid-withdrawal syndrome not related to adrenal insufficiency has occurred on withdrawal of corticosteroids.
Patients have experienced anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, arthralgias, myalgias, and postural hypotension.
Symptoms resolved when corticosteroid therapy was reinstated.
Neurologic system side effects have included convulsions, increased intracranial pressure with papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri), vertigo, and headache.
Hypersensitivity side effects have included allergic skin rash, maculopapular rash, and urticaria.
Anaphylactoid reactions have occurred with corticosteroid use.
