The more commonly observed adverse reactions have included those of pressure sensation, flushing, tingling, dizziness/vertigo, warm/hot sensation, burning sensation, flushing, and numbness; formulation specific events including injection site reactions, application site pain, and nasal discomfort have been reported.
Life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm, such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death, and rare reports of acute myocardial infarction, have been reported within a few hours after administration of -HT agonists.
Chest discomfort is usually noncardiac in origin.
A survey of  migraine patients found chest symptoms occurred in up to  of patients in at least some attacks and in up to  of patients in all attacks.
One study of  consecutive migraine patients reported that chest symptoms are frequent, but rarely important adverse effects of (primarily subcutaneous) sumatriptan (the active ingredient contained in Alsuma)   The risk of chest symptoms was reported to be patient dependent and not related, even opposite, to cardiovascular disease.
This report contradicts the hypothesis that chest symptoms after sumatriptan are caused by cardiac ischemia.
Another study of  patients concluded that panic-like symptoms may explain the chest pain and related side effects after sumatriptan administration in patients with high levels of anxiety.

Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke have occurred with -HT treatment; some have resulted in fatalities.
One case of sumatriptan-induced cortical stroke has been reported in a patient with sagittal sinus thrombosis.
In some cases, it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary, and the -HT agonist administered in the belief that presenting symptoms were due to migraine when they were not.
Patients with migraine may also be at an increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events such as stroke, hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attacks.
Medication overuse headache may present as migraine-like headaches or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks.
Serotonin syndrome is characterized by mental status changes (, agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (, tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (, hyperreflexia, incoordination), and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).
The onset of symptoms generally occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotoninergic medications.
Seizures have been reported in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures and also in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent.
Common ( to ): Abdominal discomfort, dysphagia, nausea and/or vomitingUncommon ( to ): Diarrhea, gastroesophageal refluxRare (less than ): Flatulence/eructation, gallstones, peptic ulcer, retchingFrequency not reported: Abdominal distention, colitis, constipation, dental pain, disorder of mouth and tongue (, burning of tongue, numbness of tongue, dry mouth), dyspeptic symptoms, feelings of gastrointestinal pressure, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal bleeding, gastrointestinal pain, hematemesis, hypersalivation, hyposalivation, intestinal obstruction, ischemic colitis, melena, oral itching and irritation, pancreatitis, salivary gland swelling, swallowing disorders
It is unclear whether the nausea and vomiting is related to sumatriptan therapy or to the underlying condition.
One report has suggested that "throat tightness" and chest pain associated with sumatriptan may sometimes be attributable to changes in esophageal motility.

These reports describe severe redness, pain, skin discoloration, blistering, and cracked skin.
On June , , the manufacturer of the patch suspended sales and distribution of the patch to investigate the cause of these reports.
