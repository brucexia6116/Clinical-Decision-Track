Diabetes mellitus/hyperglycemia was sometimes associated with ketoacidosis during postmarketing experience.
Redistribution/accumulation of body fat has been reported with antiretroviral therapy; causality has not been established.

1% to 1%): NeutropeniaFrequency not reported: Hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, dermal bleeding, microhemorrhagesProtease inhibitor therapy:-Frequency not reported: Increased bleeding (including spontaneous skin hematomas, hemarthrosis) in hemophiliacs
Increased bleeding (including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis) in patients with hemophilia type A and B has been associated with protease inhibitors.
In many of the reported cases, treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or restarted and some patients required additional factor VIII.
A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these episodes has not been established.

1% to 1%): Hepatitis, jaundiceFrequency not reported: Chronic active hepatitis, hepatomegaly, hyperbilirubinemia, portal hypertension, elevated GGT, hepatosplenomegaly, severe cutaneous reaction associated with increased liver function tests, increased transaminase levels, exacerbation of chronic liver disease with grade 4 elevated liver function tests, worsening liver disease, severe hepatocellular toxicity (presenting as increased hepatic transaminases), sclerosing cholangitis, cholelithiasis, liver enzyme disorder
There have been reports of worsening liver disease in patients with underlying hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis, chronic alcoholism, and/or other underlying liver abnormalities.
Severe hepatocellular toxicity (which presented as increased hepatic transaminases) occurred in healthy subjects exposed to this drug (plus ritonavir) and rifampin.
Transaminases increased up to more than 20-fold the upper limit of normal in some patients and were associated with GI symptoms (including abdominal pain, gastritis, nausea, vomiting).
Clinical symptoms resolved and hepatic transaminases returned to normal after all 3 drugs were stopped.
