More frequent side effects include: first degree atrioventricular block.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
In clinical trials, safety of this drug was evaluated in HIV--infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive patients using the individual components with other antiretrovirals for at least  weeks.
In  trial, atazanavir and cobicistat were used with emtricitabine-tenofovir (cobicistat-boosted group); in another trial, atazanavir and ritonavir were used with emtricitabine-tenofovir (ritonavir-boosted group).
In the cobicistat-boosted group, the most common side effects were jaundice, ocular icterus, and nausea; in the ritonavir-boosted group, the most common side effects were jaundice, ocular icterus, nausea, and diarrhea.
Study treatment was discontinued due to side effects in  of patients in both the cobicistat- and the ritonavir-boosted groups.
Most of the side effects included from clinical trials were of at least moderate intensity (grade  or higher).
The manufacturer product information for atazanavir and cobicistat should be consulted for additional safety information.
Increases in total bilirubin greater than  times the upper limit of normal ( x ULN) was reported in  of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and  in the ritonavir-boosted group.
Increased ALT (greater than  x ULN), AST (greater than  x ULN), and GGT (greater than  x ULN) were reported in , , and  of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group, respectively, and , , and  of patients in the ritonavir-boosted group, respectively.
Jaundice was reported in the cobicistat-boosted group (all grades: ; grades  to : ) and the ritonavir-boosted group (all grades: ; grades  to : ).
Most patients taking atazanavir experienced asymptomatic elevations in indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin related to inhibition of UGT.
This hyperbilirubinemia was reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir.
Very common ( or more): Increased total bilirubin , jaundice (up to )Common ( to ): Increased ALT, increased AST, increased GGTAtazanavir:-Very common ( or more): Elevated indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin/hyperbilirubinemia, UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) inhibited, jaundice, increased total bilirubin-Common ( to ): Increased ALT, increased AST, increased GGT-Postmarketing reports: Hepatic function abnormalities, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, cholestasis
Ocular icterus was reported in the cobicistat-boosted group (all grades: ; grades  to : ) and the ritonavir-boosted group (all grades: ; grades  to : ).
Very common ( or more): Ocular icterus (up to )Atazanavir:-Very common ( or more): Ocular icterus
Very common ( or more): Nausea (up to )Common ( to ): Increased lipase, increased serum amylaseFrequency not reported: Diarrhea, vomiting, upper abdominal painAtazanavir:-Very common ( or more): Nausea, diarrhea-Common ( to ): Increased lipase, increased serum amylase-Postmarketing reports: Pancreatitis
Nausea was reported in the cobicistat-boosted group (all grades: ; grades  to : ) and the ritonavir-boosted group (all grades: ; grades  to : ).
Diarrhea (all grades) was reported in  of patients in the ritonavir-boosted group.
Increased serum amylase (greater than  x ULN) was reported in  and  of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively.
If serum amylase was greater than  x ULN, lipase was also measured.
Increased lipase (grades  to ) was reported in  and  of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively.
Common ( to ): Rash (rash events included allergic dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity, generalized pruritus, eosinophilic pustular folliculitis, rash, generalized rash, macular rash, maculopapular rash, morbilliform rash, papular rash, urticaria)Atazanavir:-Common ( to ): Rash events-Frequency not reported: Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic skin eruptions, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, mild-to-moderate maculopapular skin eruptions-Postmarketing reports: Alopecia, maculopapular rash, pruritus, angioedema
Rash events (grades  to ) were reported in  and  of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively.
Common ( to ): Increased creatine kinaseFrequency not reported: RhabdomyolysisAtazanavir:-Common ( to ): Increased creatine kinase-Postmarketing reports: Arthralgia
Increased creatine kinase (at least  x ULN) was reported in  and  of patients in the cobicistat-boosted and ritonavir-boosted groups, respectively.
Nephrolithiasis has been reported with atazanavir.
In clinical trials, nephrolithiasis was reported in  of patients in the cobicistat-boosted group and no patients in the ritonavir-boosted group.
Onset of nephrolithiasis was about  weeks in the cobicistat-boosted group.
In clinical trials, serum creatinine increased and estimated CrCl decreases occurred early during therapy in the cobicistat-boosted group after which they stabilized.
After  weeks of therapy, eGFR (based on CrCl) change averaged - mL/min in the cobicistat-boosted group and - mL/min in the ritonavir-boosted group.
Renal impairment (including acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome) has been reported when cobicistat was used in a regimen containing tenofovir.
In clinical trials over  weeks (n=),   patients using atazanavir, cobicistat, and tenofovir discontinued therapy due to a renal side effect;  patients had laboratory findings consistent with proximal renal tubulopathy.
None of the  patients had baseline renal dysfunction (, estimated CrCl less than  mL/min).
Laboratory findings in these  patients improved but did not completely resolve in all patients when therapy was stopped.
No patients required renal replacement therapy.
