A 16-year-old female with schizophrenia experienced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) coincident with nizatidine (the active ingredient contained in Axid AR) therapy.
She had been receiving quetiapine and paroxetine for schizophrenia and depression and developed EPS after taking nizatidine 150 mg twice daily for weight loss.
