More frequent side effects include: dizziness, insomnia, rebound insomnia, headache, and irritability.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Some side effects reported with triazolam (the active ingredient contained in Halcion)  including drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, and amnesia, appear to be dose related.
Very common ( or more): Drowsiness, sedationCommon ( to ): Ataxia, concentration difficulty, dizziness, headache, impaired coordination, impaired equilibrium, lethargy, lightheadedness, tirednessUncommon ( to ): Memory impairmentFrequency not reported: Amnestic symptoms (anterograde amnesia with appropriate or inappropriate behavior), clouding of consciousness, dysesthesia, dystonia, increased muscle spasticity, paresthesia, somnambulism, syncope, taste alteration, tinnitus, travelers amnesia
Complex behaviors, such as "sleep-driving", other behaviors such as preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex, with amnesia for these events, have been reported at therapeutic doses with this medicine.
Rebound insomnia (a worsening of sleep following cessation of therapy) has been observed and has sometimes been reported to occur in association with increased daytime anxiety.
Withdrawal symptoms have included agitation, restlessness, anxiety, insomnia, psychosis, delirium, convulsions, tremor, abdominal cramps, blurred vision, vomiting, and sweating.
Worsening of insomnia, depression, or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities, including suicidal thinking, have emerged during treatment with sedative-hypnotic drugs, including triazolam (the active ingredient contained in Halcion)   The frequency and extent to which triazolam therapy is associated with adverse behavioral effects is controversial.
One study based on the postmarketing surveillance Spontaneous Reporting System of the FDA has suggested that adverse behavioral reactions have been reported  to  times more frequently in association with triazolam therapy than with temazepam therapy for insomnia.
An increased frequency of adverse behavioral effects was noted to occur most frequently in elderly patients and at higher doses of triazolam.
The methodology of this study, however, has been questioned on the grounds that spontaneous reports of adverse effects do not necessarily correlate with the incidence of adverse effects.
Other studies and reports have concluded that little evidence exists to support the contention that triazolam therapy is associated with a greater risk of adverse behavioral effects than other benzodiazepines (including temazepam).
