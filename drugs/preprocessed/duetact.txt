Common side effects of Duetact include: hypoglycemia and weight gain.
Other side effects include: edema and nausea.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most common adverse reactions included upper respiratory tract infections, accidental injury, and combined edema/peripheral edema.
Pioglitazone-SulfonylureaVery common ( or more): Lower leg edema (up to )Pioglitazone:Very common ( or more): Edema (up to )Common ( to ): Cardiac failure, chest pain
Pioglitazone is associated with edema (peripheral, generalized, and pitting edema and fluid retention) when used alone or when used in combination therapy.
In pioglitazone monotherapy trials, edema occurred in  (n=),  (n=), and  (n=) of patients receiving  mg,  mg, and  mg of pioglitazone daily for  to  weeks.
Pioglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea for  to  weeks resulted in edema in  (n=),  (n=), and  (n=) of patients receiving  mg,  mg, and  mg of pioglitazone daily, respectively.
In a study in patients with NYHA class II or III heart failure the percentage of patients experiencing CHF progression during the study was  and  in patients receiving pioglitazone (n=) and glyburide (n=), respectively.
In the PROactive trial, a study in  patients with type  diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease who were force-uptitrated to pioglitazone  mg once a day or received placebo in addition to standard of care, edema occurred in  of patients treated with pioglitazone (n=) compared with  of placebo (n=) patients.
Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to at least  hospitalized congestive heart failure event occurred in  of patients receiving pioglitazone and  of patients receiving placebo.
The primary objective of the -year PROactive trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in high-risk patients.
No statistically significant difference between pioglitazone and placebo/standard care were observed for time to the first occurrence of their first event (all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg).
A total of  patients receiving pioglitazone experienced at least  event compared with  patients receiving placebo/standard care.
Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been received in patients treated with pioglitazone.
Reports have been received from patients both with and without a history of a known history of heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin use.
Pioglitazone:Uncommon ( to ): ALT values greater than  times upper limit of normal ( x ULN)Postmarketing reports: Hepatic failureGlimepiride:Common ( to ): Elevated ALT to greater than  x ULNPostmarketing reports: Liver function impairment (  with cholestasis and jaundice), as well as hepatitis, which may progress to liver failure, hepatic porphyria reactions and disulfiram-like reactions
There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic reactions in patients receiving glimepiride such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, dyspnea, hypotension, and shock.
In clinical trials allergic reactions such as pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and morbilliform or maculopapular eruptions, occurred in less than  of patients receiving glimepiride, and some resolved despite continued treatment.
Glimepiride:Uncommon ( to ): Allergic reactionsPostmarketing reports: Serious allergic reactions
The US FDA has released results of its review of pioglitazone and bladder cancer and concluded that the data suggests use of this drug may be linked to an increase risk of bladder cancer.
A -year prospective cohort study in diabetic patients performed by the manufacturer (n=, never users; n=, ever users) identified  newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer in never users and  cases in ever users.
The fully adjusted hazard ratio (HR) showed pioglitazone use was not associated with an increased risk (HR  ( confidence interval  to ).
And while a modest trend towards higher risk with increasing duration was observed, this trend was not statistically significant.
Compared to the interim -year results, the -year results found weaker associations that were not statistically significant.
However, there are studies that have shown a statistically significant association between exposure to this drug and bladder cancer and an association between cumulative dose or cumulative duration of exposure and bladder cancer.
Overall, this drug may be associated with an increase in the risk of urinary bladder tumors, however there is insufficient data to determine whether this drug is a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors.
Pioglitazone:Uncommon ( to ): Bladder cancer
Pioglitazone:Frequency not reported: Resumption of ovulation in premenopausal, anovulatory women, hormonal imbalance Glimepiride:Postmarketing reports: Hyponatremia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)
SIADH has been reported postmarketing in patients receiving glimepiride, most often in patients who are on other medications or who have medical conditions known to cause hyponatremia or increase release of antidiuretic hormone.
Pioglitazone:Postmarketing reports: New or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity
Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone or another thiazolidinedione.
Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but some patients appear to have been diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination.
Some patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed.
Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of their thiazolidinedione.
It is unknown whether or not there is a causal relationship between pioglitazone and macular edema.
Pioglitazone is associated with dose-related weight gain when used alone or when used in combination therapy.
The mechanism of weight gain is unclear, but probably involves a combination of fluid retention and fat accumulation.
In pioglitazone monotherapy trials, weight increases of  kg,  kg, and  kg occurred in patients receiving  mg,  mg, and  mg of pioglitazone daily for  to  weeks.
Pioglitazone in combination with a sulfonylurea for  to  weeks resulted in weight increases of  kg,  kg, and  kg, for patients receiving  mg,  mg, and  mg of pioglitazone daily respectively.
In the PROactive (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events) trial, the median change in body weight in patients treated with pioglitazone (n=) compared with placebo (n=) was - kg compared to + kg.
The median exposure to drug was  years.
Pioglitazone-SulfonylureaVery common ( or more): Hypoglycemia (up to ), weight increase (up to )
Pioglitazone-SulfonylureaVery common ( or more): Upper respiratory tract infection (up to )Common ( to ): Sinusitis, pharyngitisPioglitazone:Very common ( or more): Upper respiratory tract infection (up to )
Pioglitazone-SulfonylureaFrequency not reported: AnemiaPioglitazone:Frequency not reported: Decreases in hemoglobin and hematocritGlimepiride:Postmarketing reports: Hemolytic Anemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenia purpura
Laboratory findings have shown decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit with pioglitazone therapy; mean hemoglobin values declined by  to  in pioglitazone treated patients compared to - to  in placebo-treated patients.
These changes primarily occurred during the first  months.
Changes may be related to increased plasma volume and not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects.
Pioglitazone-SulfonylureaCommon ( to ): Diarrhea, nausea
Pioglitazone-SulfonylureaCommon ( to ): Headache, dizziness
Pioglitazone-SulfonylureaCommon ( to ): Limb painPioglitazone:Common ( to ): Myalgia, pain in extremity, back painFrequency not reported: Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK)
Elevations in CPK were observed during protocol-specified measurement of CPK in pioglitazone clinical trials.
Isolated elevation to  times the upper limit of normal was observed in  patients .
Elevations resolved without any clinical sequelae and the relationship to drug therapy is unknown.
