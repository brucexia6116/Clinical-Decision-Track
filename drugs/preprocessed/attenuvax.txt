If any of the following side effects occur while taking measles virus vaccine, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
Fever or skin rash may occur from  to  days after vaccination and usually lasts several days.
Local side effects have included injection site burning/stinging, wheal and flare, erythema, swelling, and vesiculation.
Hypersensitivity reactions have included anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions, angioneurotic edema (including peripheral or facial edema), and bronchial spasm.
Cardiovascular side effects have included vasculitis.
Dermatologic side effects have included Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, erythema multiforme, urticaria, and rash.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included diarrhea.
Hematologic side effects have included thrombocytopenia, purpura, regional lymphadenopathy, and leukocytosis.
Musculoskeletal side effects have included arthralgia and/or arthritis (usually transient and rarely chronic), polyneuritis, myalgia, paresthesia, and rarely chronic arthritis; these symptoms may also occur with natural rubella.
Significant central nervous system reactions such as encephalitis and encephalopathy have been very rarely temporally associated with measles vaccine (occurring within  days after vaccination); however, causality has not been determined in any case.
A certain number of  encephalitis cases unrelated to vaccines is expected to occur in a large childhood population; however, there is the possibility that some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccine.
The risk of measles vaccine-associated serious neurological disorders is much smaller than the risk for encephalitis and encephalopathy due to natural measles.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) has been very rarely reported in children after measles vaccination.
Some of these cases may have been due to unrecognized measles during the first year of life or possibly due to the measles vaccination.
The results of a retrospective case-controlled study by the U.
S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that measles vaccine has had the overall effect of protecting against SSPE by preventing measles with its greater risk of SSPE.
Nervous system side effects have included measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), encephalopathy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), Guillain-Barr Syndrome (GBS), febrile convulsions, afebrile convulsions or seizures, ataxia, and ocular palsies.
Ocular side effects have included retinitis, optic neuritis, papillitis, retrobulbar neuritis, and conjunctivitis.
Otic side effects have included nerve deafness and otitis media.
Respiratory side effects have included pneumonitis, cough, and rhinitis.
A postmarketing surveillance study of measles/mumps/rubella vaccine in Finland during  to  with  million pediatric and adult vaccinees reported no deaths or permanent sequelae.
Other side effects have included panniculitis, atypical measles, fever, syncope, headache, dizziness, malaise, and irritability.
Fatalities have been reported with the polyvalent measles/mumps/rubella vaccine; however, causality has not been determined.
Health care providers should report any allergic or unusual adverse reactions to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at --- (USA) and the manufacturer.
