A side effect is usually regarded as an undesirable secondary effect which
occurs in addition to the desired therapeutic effect of a drug or
medication.
Side effects may vary for each individual depending on the person's disease
state, age, weight, gender, ethnicity and general health.
Side effects can occur when commencing, decreasing/increasing dosages, or
ending a drug or medication regimen.
Side effects may also lead to
non-compliance with prescribed treatment.
When side effects of a drug or medication are severe, the dosage may be
adjusted or a second medication may be prescribed.
Lifestyle or dietary
changes may also help to minimize side effects.
