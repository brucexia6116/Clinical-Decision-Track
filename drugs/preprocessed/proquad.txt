As well as its needed effects, measles virus vaccine / mumps virus vaccine / rubella virus vaccine / varicella virus vaccine may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some measles virus vaccine / mumps virus vaccine / rubella virus vaccine / varicella virus vaccine side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most common adverse events were injection site reactions and fever.
Deaths have been reported following vaccination with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines; however, a causal relationship has not been established in healthy individuals.
Death as a direct consequence of disseminated measles vaccine virus infection has been reported in severely immunocompromised individuals in whom a measles-containing vaccine is contraindicated and who were inadvertently vaccinated.
Very common ( or more): Fever (up to ) Common ( to ): Viral infectionUncommon ( to ): Malaise, fatigueRare ( to ): Otitis mediaVery rare (less than ): Kawasaki syndromePostmarketing reports: Candidiasis, infection, ear pain, trauma, death
Very common ( or more): Injection site pain/tenderness/soreness (up to ), injection site erythema , injection site swelling  Common ( to ): Injection site bruising, injection site rash, injection site pruritusPostmarketing reports: Extravasation, injection-site complaints (burning and/or stinging of short duration, eczema, edema/swelling, hive-like rash, discoloration, hematoma, induration, lump, vesicles, wheal and flare), inflammation, venipuncture site hemorrhage, warm sensation, warm to touch
Very common ( or more): Rash (up to )Common ( to ): Measles-like rash, varicella-like rash, viral exanthemaVery rare (less than ): Erythema multiformePostmarketing reports: Atypical measles, cellulitis, herpes zoster, measles, skin infection, varicella (vaccine strain), Henoch-Schonlein purpura, herpes simplex, impetigo, panniculitis, pruritus, purpura, skin induration, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, sunburn, varicella-like rash, roughness/dryness

Encephalitis and encephalopathy have been reported approximately once for every  million doses of the combination of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.
Some of these cases may have been caused by measles vaccines.
The risk of serious neurological disorders for encephalitis and encephalopathy with wild-type measles is  per  reported cases.
There have been reports of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) in children with no history of infection with wild-type measles but who did receive measles vaccine.
Some of these cases may have resulted from unrecognized measles in the first year of life or possibly from the measles vaccination.
Based on estimated measles vaccine distribution in the United States (US), the association of SSPE cases to measles vaccination is about one case per million vaccine doses distributed.
The association with wild-type measles virus infection is  to  cases of SSPE per million cases of measles.
Cases of aseptic meningitis have been reported following measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination.
Although a causal relationship between other strains of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis has been shown, there is no evidence to link Jeryl Lynn (TM) mumps vaccine to aseptic meningitis.
Uncommon ( to ): Somnolence, lethargy Rare ( to ): Febrile seizuresVery rare (less than ): Meningitis, encephalitis, cerebrovascular accident, cerebellitis, cerebellitis like symptoms, Guillain Barr syndrome, transverse myelitis, peripheral neuritisPostmarketing reports: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), afebrile convulsions or seizures, aseptic meningitis, ataxia, Bell's palsy, convulsion, dizziness, dream abnormality, encephalitis, encephalopathy, febrile seizure, headache, hypersomnia, measles inclusion body encephalitis, ocular palsies, paresthesia, polyneuritis, polyneuropathy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, syncope, transverse myelitis, tremor, nerve deafness

Cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported after use of measles; measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); and varicella vaccination.
Individuals with current thrombocytopenia may develop more severe thrombocytopenia following vaccination.
In addition, individuals who experienced thrombocytopenia following the first dose of MMR may develop thrombocytopenia with repeat doses.
Uncommon ( to ): LymphadenopathyVery rare (less than ): Thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpuraPostmarketing reports: Aplastic anemia, lymphadenitis, regional lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia
Very rare (less than ): Allergic reactions (including anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions)Postmarketing reports: Anaphylaxis and related phenomena such as angioneurotic edema, facial edema, and peripheral edema, anaphylaxis in individuals with or without an allergic history
Uncommon ( to ): Anorexia
Chronic arthritis has been associated with wild-type rubella infection and has been related to persistent virus and/or viral antigen isolated from body tissues.
Recipients of rubella vaccine may develop chronic joint symptoms.
Arthralgia and/or arthritis, and polyneuritis after wild-type rubella virus infection vary in frequency and severity with age and gender, being greatest in adult females and least in pre-pubertal children.
Following vaccination in children, reactions in joints are uncommon ( to ) and of brief duration.
In women, incidence rates for arthritis and arthralgia are higher than those seen in children ( to ), and the reactions tend to be more marked and of longer duration (, months or years).
In adolescent girls, the reactions appear to be intermediate in incidence between those seen in children and adult women.
Very rare (less than ): Arthralgia, arthritisPostmarketing reports: Musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, pain of the hip, leg, or neck, swelling, stiffness
Very rare (less than ): Orchitis, epididymitis
Postmarketing reports: Edema of the eyelid, irritation, necrotizing retinitis (reported only in immunocompromised individuals), optic neuritis, retinitis, retrobulbar neuritis
