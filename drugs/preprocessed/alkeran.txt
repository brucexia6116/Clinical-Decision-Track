Along with their needed effects, medicines like melphalan (the active ingredient contained in Alkeran) can sometimes cause unwanted effects such as blood problems and other side effects.
These and others are described below.
Also, because of the way these medicines act on the body, there is a chance that they might cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.
These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer, such as leukemia.
Discuss these possible effects with your doctor.
Hematologic side effects including bone marrow suppression and anemia have been reported.
Bone marrow suppression is the most common and the most significant toxicity associated with melphalan (the active ingredient contained in Alkeran) in most patients.

Bone marrow suppression is usually reversible if melphalan is withdrawn early enough.
The risk of leukemogenesis increases with chronicity of treatment and with cumulative dose.
