Common side effects of Norvir include: asthenia, diarrhea, hypertriglyceridemia, increased gamma-glutamyl transferase, nausea, vomiting, and unpleasant taste.
Other side effects include: abdominal pain, dyspepsia, fever, hyperlipidemia, increased serum alanine aminotransferase, peripheral paresthesia, dysgeusia, and oral paresthesia.

As well as its needed effects, ritonavir (the active ingredient contained in Norvir) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some ritonavir side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
