At recommended dosages, clomiphene (the active ingredient contained in Clomid) is generally well tolerated.
Adverse reactions usually are mild, transient, and resolve when clomiphene is discontinued.
Male sterility after high dose therapy may be due to hyalinization of the tubular membranes and damage to the spermatids.
In general, clomiphene (the active ingredient contained in Clomid) enhances spermatozoal motility and does not change the sperm to abnormal or immature forms.

A -year-old woman receiving clomiphene citrate treatment for ovulation induction was admitted for complaints of swelling and pain in her right calf.
Her medical history was unremarkable except for complications following an appendectomy three years prior which resulted in a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism.
The patient had been taking clomiphene two days prior to the development of the first DVT.
Six months later, the treatment with clomiphene was renewed.
The patient developed recurrent DVT following repeated standard clomiphene treatment.
