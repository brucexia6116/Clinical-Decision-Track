Common side effects of Remicade include: abdominal pain, back pain, chest pain, and nausea.
Other side effects include: candidiasis, diarrhea, pruritus, sinusitis, and vomiting.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, infliximab (the active ingredient contained in Remicade) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
One of the most-common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (, dyspnea, flushing, headache, and rash)
Very common ( or more): Viral infection (, influenza, herpes virus infection)Common ( to ): Bacterial infections (, sepsis, cellulitis, abscess), moniliasisUncommon ( to ): Tuberculosis, fungal infections (, candidiasis), vaginitisRare (less than ): Meningitis, opportunistic infections (such as invasive fungal infections [pneumocystosis, histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis], bacterial infections [atypical mycobacterial, listeriosis, salmonellosis], and viral infections [cytomegalovirus]), parasitic infections, hepatitis B reactivation
Most cases of tuberculosis occurred within the first two months after the start of infliximab therapy and may reflect recrudescence of latent disease.
Cutaneous and miliary tuberculosis, as a result of tuberculosis reactivation, has been reported in a -year-old white male with a history of Crohn's disease treated with infliximab.
Infections have been observed in all organ systems and have been reported in patients receiving infliximab alone or in combination with immunosuppressive agents.
Patients with antibodies to infliximab were more likely to have higher rates of clearance, reduced efficacy, and to experience an infusion reaction.
Crohn's patients with (+) ANA prior to infliximab were approximately  times as likely to develop anti-dsDNA antibodies.
Various case reports of non-Crohn's and Crohn's patient, developed clinical symptoms of a lupus-like syndrome.
Symptoms resolved and antibodies disappeared when infliximab was discontinued.
Disseminated Salmonella typhimurium infection has been reported in a Fijian Indian man while undergoing his twenty-eighth week of infliximab therapy for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
Patient's symptoms resolved after treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin.
Disseminated cryptococcal infection has been reported in a -year-old male after his second infusion of infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis.
A -year-old male developed protothecosis after a stem cell transplantation coincident with infliximab therapy.
He was administered infliximab for graft-versus-host disease.
Two weeks later, he became lethargic and developed bilateral olecranon bursitis and bullous skin lesions.
Blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae and Prototheca wickerhamii.
The patient subsequently developed multiorgan failure and died after  weeks of hospitalization.
The use of infliximab likely played a role in this case.

Common ( to ): Hot flush, flushing, fatigue, fever, chillsUncommon ( to ): Impaired healing, autoantibody positiveRare (less than ): Granulomatous lesion, complement factor abnormal
In order to avoid the development of delayed severe systemic reactions, some researchers recommend multiple early infusions of infliximab (the active ingredient contained in Remicade) if retreatment is anticipated.
Delayed hypersensitivity reactions during psoriasis studies generally occurred within  weeks following repeat infusion.
During one clinical trial, Crohn's disease patients were retreated following  to  years without infliximab.
Patients experiencing side effects following readministration did not have infusion-related side effects associated with their initial infliximab treatment.
Uncommon ( to ): Anaphylactic reaction, lupus-like syndrome, serum sickness or serum sickness-like reaction Rare (less than ): Anaphylactic shock, vasculitis, sarcoid-like reactionFrequency not reported: Facial, hand, or lip edema, sore throat

One patient reported hypoesthesia in the left leg eight hours after her first infliximab infusion.
Another patient reported dysesthesia in the distribution of the left peroneal nerve, after her th intravenous infliximab infusion.
Although demyelination observed in postmarketing experience did not show causal relationship between adverse events and infliximab, the neurologic side effects resolved, partially or completely, on discontinuation of therapy.
A -year-old female with Crohn's disease experienced meningitis coincident with infliximab therapy.
The patient developed a headache, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and meningismus after receiving an infliximab infusion.
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was remarkable for a neutrophilic pleocytosis and elevated protein.
Other potential causes of meningitis were ruled out.
The patient's symptoms completely resolved within  hours of presentation.
A -year-old female with a -year history of Crohn disease experienced acute neuropathy with multiple conduction blocks coincident with infliximab therapy.
Infliximab ( mg/kg,  infusions in  years) therapy was added to azathioprine ( mg per day)  years into her disease.

The patient presented with a -day history of fever, headache, confusion, agitation, nausea, malaise, myalgias, gait instability, and rapidly worsening lower extremity weakness.
He had received infliximab  weeks prior to symptom onset.
His only other medications were amlodipine ( mg per day) and methotrexate ( mg per week).
WNF was confirmed by with cerebral spinal fluid positive for WNV IgM antibodies by ELISA capture technique.
The patient eventually died due to WNF infection.
A -year-old female with erosive rheumatoid arthritis experienced neurosarcoidosis coincident with infliximab therapy.
She had been successfully treated with infliximab  mg/kg every  to  weeks together with methotrexate, without side effects.
Approximately five years later, after receiving an infliximab infusion, she experienced feeling tired, a low grade fever, and headache.
Two weeks later, she presented without any neurological symptoms besides headache.
She was hospitalized one week later.
The headache remained unchanged and  weeks after admission, she developed diplopia.
At neuron-ophthalmological examination, nerve palsy of the left eye and a severe papilledema in both eyes were observed.
Further, bilateral granulomatous iridocyclitis and retinal periphlebitis, typical for sarcoidosis, were noted.
The sarcoidosis diagnosis was supported by the increased activity in the mediastinal lymph nodes bilaterally and in the parotid glands observed with In-DTPA-octreotide scintigraphy.
She received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt  weeks after being admitted.
Following surgery, the patient became free of headache and the pathological ophthalmologic changes slowly subsided.
A -year-old female reported she was hospitalized for five days due to a reaction characterized by shaking uncontrollably due to taking infliximab.
The patient did not know the date of admission stating it was a long time ago when she was in her twenties.

A -year-old female with Crohn disease experienced acne coincident with infliximab therapy.
The patient had been administered infliximab  mg/kg with rapid and effective symptomatic control.
Several weeks after initiating infliximab therapy, the patient developed a papulopustular eruption on the face and back with some comedones.
The eruption persisted, albeit with fluctuating severity, and dermatological opinion was obtained.
Histology was consistent with the clinical diagnosis of acne and other Crohn disease-associated dermatoses were excluded.
Infliximab was not discontinued because of the excellent control of the bowel disease.
Instead, the patient was treated with minocycline  mg daily.

Results of a skin biopsy suggested leprosy or Hansen disease.
He was treated with multidrug therapy (MDT) of dapsone ( mg daily), clofazimine ( mg daily), and rifampin ( mg monthly).
One month after starting this treatment, the patient developed "reversal," or type , reactions.
After  years, the cutaneous lesions had resolved, and MDT was withdrawn.
Results of a skin biopsy performed  years after diagnosis showed advanced regression of the lesion with no residual bacilli.
A -year-old female with Crohn disease developed palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) coincident with infliximab therapy.
