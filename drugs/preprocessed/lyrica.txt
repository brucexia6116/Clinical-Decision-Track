Symptoms of angioedema have included swelling of the face, mouth (tongue, lips, and gums), and neck (throat and larynx).
There have also been reports of life-threatening angioedema with respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment.
Therapy should be discontinued immediately in patients with these symptoms.
