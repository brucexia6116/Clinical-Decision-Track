Commonly reported side effects of conjugated estrogens include: infection, upper respiratory tract infection, abdominal pain, back pain, dizziness, dyspepsia, headache, hypermenorrhea, leg cramps, paresthesia, and mastalgia.
Other side effects include: anxiety, constipation, diarrhea, hypertonia, increased cough, vaginitis, and vomiting.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Other dosage forms:
-HRT is associated with a  to -fold increased relative risk of developing VTE, i.
e.
, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
This event is more likely to occur in the first year of using HRT.
-The use of estrogen-only and estrogen-progestin therapy is associated with an up to  fold increased relative risk of ischemic stroke.
-The risk of hemorrhagic stroke is not increased during use of HRT.
This relative risk is not dependent on age or on duration of use, but as the baseline risk is strongly age-dependent, the overall risk of stroke in women who use HRT will increase with age.

Breast cancer: -An up to -fold increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed is reported in women taking combined estrogen-progestin therapy for more than  years.
-Any increased risk in users of estrogen-only therapy is substantially lower than that seen in users of estrogen-progestin combinations.
The level of risk is dependent on the duration of use.
Endometrial Cancer:-Endometrial cancer risk is about  in every  women with a uterus not using HRT.
-In women with a uterus, use of estrogen-only HRT is not recommended because it increases the risk of endometrial cancer.
-Depending on the duration of estrogen-only use and estrogen dose, the increase in risk of endometrial cancer varied from between  and  extra cases diagnosed in every  women between the ages of  and   -Adding a progestin to estrogen-only therapy for at least  days per cycle can prevent this increased risk.
In the Million Women Study the use of five years of combined HRT did not increase risk of endometrial cancer.
Ovarian cancer:-Long-term use of estrogen-only and combined estrogen-progestin HRT has been associated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer.
In the Million Women Study  years of HRT resulted in  extra case per  users.
