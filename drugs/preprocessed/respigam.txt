As well as its needed effects, respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin (the active ingredient contained in RespiGam) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking respiratory syncytial virus immune globulin, check with your doctor immediately:
Renal side effects associated with sucrose-containing IGIV infusion have included increased serum creatinine, increased BUN level, oliguria, anuria, acute renal failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy, and osmotic nephrosis.
Other side effects has included fever/pyrexia  and overdose effect .
Pallor, cold/clammy skin, gagging, and fluid overload have been reported rarely.
Other side effects associated with other IGIV derivatives have included flushing.
This effect is often related to the rate of infusion.
Respiratory side effects have included respiratory distress , wheezing , rales , tachypnea , and hypoxia/hypoxemia .
Cyanosis, cough, and rhinorrhea have been reported rarely.
Respiratory side effects associated with other IGIV derivatives have included dyspnea.
This effect is often related to the rate of infusion.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included vomiting , diarrhea , and gastroenteritis .
Gastrointestinal side effects associated with other IGIV derivatives have included abdominal cramps.
This effect is often related to the rate of infusion.
The CARDIAC study reported an increase in frequency of cardiac surgery in children with left and right shunts.
All enrollees (n=) had preexisting congenital heart disease of less than  months duration at time of enrollment.
The study also reported a greater frequency of severe and life-threatening side effects associated with the cardiac surgery.
Cardiovascular side effects reported in  of patients have included fluid overload, tachycardia, increased pulse rate, and hypertension.
Edema, hypotension, and heart murmur have been reported rarely.
Cardiovascular side effects associated with other IGIV derivatives have included blood pressure changes, palpitations, and chest tightness.
These effects are usually related to the rate of infusion.
Dermatologic side effects have included rash .
Eczema has been reported rarely.
Dermatologic side effects associated with other IGIV derivatives have included pruritus.

These effects are often related to the rate of infusion.
Hypersensitivity side effects, including anaphylactic reactions, have been associated with other IGIV derivatives.
Aseptic meningitis syndrome has been associated with high doses ( g/kg) of IGIV.
Aseptic meningitis of unknown etiology has been reported in three pediatric patients during RSV-IGIV therapy in the PREVENT trial.
Subsequent findings reported one child to have a presumptive diagnosis of enteroviral infection, and another child to have an unconfirmed diagnosis of Herpes simplex meningitis related to treatment with acyclovir.
The third child developed fever, vomiting, and malaise associated with  cells per mm in the cerebrospinal fluid.
Immunologic side effects associated with other IGIV derivatives have rarely included aseptic meningitis syndrome.
