Commonly reported side effects of galsulfase include: severe infusion related reaction, conjunctivitis, rigors, chest pain, development of igg antibodies, dyspnea, infusion related reaction, otalgia, pain, and pharyngitis.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions included rash, pain, urticaria, pyrexia, pruritus, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and dyspnea.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions requiring interventions are infusion-related reactions.
Frequency not reported: Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reaction, allergic reaction
Very common ( or more): Rash , angioedema, urticaria, pruritusCommon ( to ): Erythema
Very common ( or more): Abdominal pain , gastroenteritis , umbilical hernia , nausea, vomiting
Very common ( or more): Infusion reactions , ear pain , pain , chills/rigors , chest pain , malaise , hearing impairment , pyrexia
Infusion reactions, which occurred in  of patients across  clinical studies were defined as adverse reactions occurring during infusions or until the end of the infusion day.
Infusion reactions were observed as early as week  and as late as week  of treatment and occurred during multiple infusions, however, not always in consecutive weeks.
The most common signs/symptoms included pruritus, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, hypertension, headache, chest pain, erythema, cough, hypotension, angioedema, respiratory distress, tremor, conjunctivitis, malaise, bronchospasm, and arthralgia.
Very common ( or more): Hypertension Common ( to ): HypotensionFrequency not reported: Pallor, bradycardia, tachycardia, cyanosis, shock
Very common ( or more): Areflexia , headacheCommon ( to ): TremorFrequency not reported: Paresthesia
Very common ( or more): Dyspnea , pharyngitis , nasal congestion Common ( to ): Apnea, cough, respiratory distress, asthma, bronchospasmFrequency not reported: Laryngeal edema, hypoxia, tachypnea, sleep apneaPostmarketing reports: Respiratory failure
Very common ( or more): Arthralgia 
Very common ( or more): Conjunctivitis , corneal opacity 
Very common ( or more): Development of antidrug antibodies 
During clinical trials,  out of  patients tested positive for antidrug IgG antibodies within  to  weeks of treatment.
In the placebo controlled study,  patients were evaluated for a potential relationship between development of antidrug antibodies to clinical outcome measures.
While all  patients developed antidrug antibodies, there was no consistent predictive relationship between total antibody titer, neutralizing or IgE antibodies, and infusion-associated reactions, urinary glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels, or endurance measures.
