Keep track of any and all side effects your child has after receiving this vaccine.
When the
child receives a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shots caused any side
effects.
Becoming infected with haemophilus B is much more dangerous to your childs health than
receiving the vaccine to protect against it.
Like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects, but
the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.
Get emergency medical help if your child has any of these signs of an allergic
reaction:  hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Call your doctor at once if your child has any of these serious side effects:
pale skin, severe weakness, dizziness, fast heartbeat;
extreme drowsiness, fainting;
fussiness, irritability, crying for an hour or longer;
seizure (black-out or convulsions); or
high fever (within a few hours or a few days after the
vaccine).
Less serious side effects may be more likely to occur, such as:
redness, pain, swelling, or a lump where the shot was given;
low fever;
mild fussiness or crying;
joint pain, body aches;
drowsiness; or
diarrhea.
This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
Call your
doctor for medical advice about side effects.
