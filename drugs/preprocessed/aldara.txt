Common side effects of Aldara include: dermal ulcer, application site reaction, burning sensation, desquamation, edema, excoriation, exfoliation of skin, pruritus, skin erosion, and erythema.
Other side effects include: back pain, headache, and pain.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
In general, the side effects associated with imiquimod topical (the active ingredient contained in Aldara) may vary depending on the condition being treated.
Local skin reactions were recorded as adverse reactions only if they extended beyond the treatment area, if they required any medical intervention, or they resulted in patient discontinuation from a study.
In studies involving treatment of actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma, the dermatologic side effects classified as local and application site most frequently resulted in clinical intervention (, rest periods, withdrawal from study, treatment site infections requiring treatment with antibiotics).
Flaking/scaling was reported in  of males and  of females and scabbing/crusting was reported in  of males and  of females; otherwise, frequency and severity of local skin reactions were similar in both genders.
Local side effects have included application site reaction (up to ), application site pain (up to ), application site irritation (up to ), application site pruritus (up to ), application site bleeding, application site swelling, treatment site infection, scarring, application site rash, application site cellulitis, and application site excoriation.
Local skin reactions have included erythema (all grades: up to ; severe: up to ), scabbing/crusting (all grades: up to ; severe: up to ), flaking/scaling/dryness (all grades: up to ; severe: up to ), flaking/scaling (all grades:  ; severe: ), induration (all grades: up to  ; severe: up to ), edema (all grades: up to ; severe: up to ), erosion (all grades: up to  ; severe: up to ), erosion/ulceration (all grades: up to ; severe: up to ), exudate (all grades: up to ; severe: ), ulceration (all grades: up to  ; severe: up to ), weeping/exudate (all grades: up to ), vesicles (all grades: up to ; severe: up to ), excoriation/flaking (all grades: up to ; severe: up to ), and scabbing (all grades: up to ).
Application site reactions have included itching (up to ), burning , bleeding (up to ), stinging , pain , erythema , papule(s) , induration , tenderness (up to ), irritation , and infection .
Application site disorders reported in more than  of patients have included burning, hypopigmentation, rash, sensitivity, soreness, stinging, and tenderness.
Itching ( in females,  in males), burning ( in females,  in males), pain ( in females,  in males), and soreness ( in females) were reported at the wart site.
Tingling at the application site has been reported during postmarketing experience.
Respiratory side effects have included upper respiratory tract infection (up to ), sinusitis (up to ), rhinitis , coughing , and pharyngitis .
Pulmonary congestion and bronchitis have been reported.

Two cases involving the development of chronic neuropathic pain following initiation of imiquimod topical (the active ingredient contained in Aldara) therapy for the treatment of warts have been reported.
In the first case, a -year-old man with genital warts reported an erosion with substantial pain on the left lateral glans of the penis approximately  week following initiation of therapy with imiquimod applied topically  times a week.
Imiquimod therapy was discontinued; however, the patient continued to report a burning-like pain and erythema in the area for approximately  years.
The condition may have been exacerbated by aerobic exercise, sweating, and sexual activity.
In the second case report, a -year-old woman with plantar warts developed numbness and pain in all toes and the balls of both feet following approximately  months of therapy with imiquimod topical applied each night with tape occlusion.
Imiquimod topical was discontinued.
This condition may have been exacerbated by a daily paring of the warts by the patient prior to imiquimod application.
Approximately  years later, the patient reported a gradual improvement in the numbness and an absence of the burning-like pain.
Neither patient had diabetes mellitus, or any other condition known to result in possible neuropathic pain.
Nervous system side effects have included headache (up to ), dizziness (up to ), insomnia, and lethargy.
Nervous system side effects have rarely included neuropathic pain.
Agitation, convulsions (including febrile convulsions), insomnia, multiple sclerosis aggravation, and paresis have been reported during postmarketing experience.

Abdominal pain has been reported during postmarketing experience.
A review of  case reports involving patients receiving imiquimod topical applied  or  times weekly for treatment of actinic cheilitis in the lip region reported the formation of aphthous ulcers approximately  to  weeks following initiation of treatment.
In each case, the aphthous ulcers resolved upon discontinuation of imiquimod topical and treatment with a topical steroid.
None of the patients consented to a rechallenge.
An -year-old Caucasian woman developed invasive amelanotic melanoma with satellite lesions within  weeks after initiation of treatment with imiquimod three times per week.
It is unknown if this was a probable side effect of imiquimod or a progressive event of melanoma in situ.
Oncologic side effects have included squamous cell carcinoma (up to ).
Basal cell carcinoma has been reported.
Oncologic side effects reported during non-FDA approved treatment of melanoma in situ have included a single case report of the development of invasive melanoma.

In the studies involving treatment of genital/perianal warts, the skin reactions reported were more frequent and more intense with daily application of the cream than with the application of the cream three times per week.
In studies involving treatment of actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma, the dermatologic side effects classified as local and application site most frequently resulted in clinical intervention (, rest periods, withdrawal from study, treatment site infections requiring treatment with antibiotics).

Hyperkeratosis, rash, skin disorder, photosensitivity reaction, verruca, and remote site irritation have been reported.
Imiquimod-induced psoriasis and at least  case each of vitiligo-like hyperpigmentation, contact pemphigus, pityriasis rubra pilaris exacerbation, erosive pustular dermatosis of the scalp, and eruptive keratoacanthoma have been reported.

Aggravation of allergy has been reported.
A -year-old man developed angioedema  weeks into treatment for squamous cell carcinoma in situ located on the right forearm.
One week prior he had developed ulceration over the application site.
The angioedema started in the right hand at which time the imiquimod therapy was discontinued.
Within  hours of discontinuation the angioedema had encompassed both hands and feet and the ulcerated application site.
Fifty-four hours following discontinuation of therapy the patient was awakened by severe swelling of the tongue, diagnosed by the emergency room physician as angioedema of the tongue.
The patient experienced difficulty talking and swallowing, but no respiratory distress.
The patient denied presence of chills, fever, or influenza-like symptoms.
The patient denied history of urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis.
The patient was stable on all medications prior to initiation of imiquimod therapy.
The patient improved following treatment with intravenous diphenhydramine and methylprednisolone.
It is thought that the large application site ( m) and the ulceration may have facilitated in the absorption of imiquimod resulting in the angioedema.
Metabolic side effects have included hypercholesterolemia and gout.
Hepatic side effects have included abnormal liver function during postmarketing experience.
Endocrine side effects have included thyroiditis during postmarketing experience.
