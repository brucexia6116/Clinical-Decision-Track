Common side effects of Glyxambi include: urinary tract infection.
Other side effects include: increased ldl cholesterol.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Linagliptin:Postmarketing reports: RashDipeptidyl peptidase- (DPP-) inhibitors:-Postmarketing cases: Bullous pemphigoid
Postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP- inhibitors.
Discontinuation of therapy and treatment with topical or systemic immunosuppressive agents led to resolution in reported cases.
Pancreatitis was reported in  cases per , patient year exposure in patients receiving linagliptin compared to  cases per , patient year exposure in those receiving active comparator (placebo or sulfonylurea), during clinical trials.
Following completing of clinical trials,  additional cases of pancreatitis were reported in those receiving linagliptin.
Postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatalities, have been reported.
Empagliflozin:Common ( to ): NauseaLinagliptin:Common ( to ): DiarrheaFrequency not reported: PancreatitisPostmarketing reports: Acute pancreatitis
Empagliflozin-Linagliptin:Very Common ( or more): Urinary tract infection (up to )Postmarketing reports: Urosepsis, pyelonephritisEmpagliflozin:Common ( to ): Urinary tract infection, female genital mycotic infections, increased urination, male genital mycotic infections
Empagliflozin-Linagliptin:Frequency not reported: Increased hematocritEmpagliflozin:Common ( to ): Increased hematocrit
Postmarketing, serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and exfoliative skin conditions have been reported in patients treated with linagliptin.
These reactions have occurred within the first  months and some have occurred after the first dose.
Linagliptin:Frequency not reported: Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioedema, localized skin exfoliation, or bronchial hyper-reactivityPostmarketing reports: Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis
When this combination product was added to metformin therapy, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was  and  in patients receiving empagliflozin  mg-linagliptin  mg and empagliflozin  mg-linagliptin  mg, respectively.
There were no reports of serious hypoglycemia.
Twenty reports of acidosis have been identified in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database during the period March  through  June   All patients required emergency room treatment or hospitalization.
These cases were not typical of ketoacidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in that they occurred in patients with type  diabetes and their blood sugar levels were only slightly increased.
Some factors identified as potentially triggering the acidosis included major illness, reduced food and fluid intake, and reduced insulin dose.
Empagliflozin-Linagliptin:Common ( to ): Hypoglycemia, increased cholesterolEmpagliflozin:Common ( to ): Increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, dyslipidemiaPostmarketing reports: Acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis, or ketosis	Linagliptin:Common ( to ): Increased uric acid
Dipeptidyl peptidase- (DPP-) inhibitors:-Common ( to ): Arthralgia-Postmarketing cases: Severe and disabling arthralgia
Between October  and December , thirty-three cases of severe arthralgia have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Database.
Each case involved the use of  or more dipeptidyl peptidase- (DPP-) inhibitor.
In all cases, substantial reduction in prior activity level was reported,  patients were hospitalized due to disabling joint pain.
In  cases, symptoms appeared within  month of starting therapy, in  cases symptoms resolved less than  month after discontinuation.
A positive rechallenge was reported in  cases, with  cases involving use of a different DPP- inhibitor.
Sitagliptin had the greatest number of cases reported (n=) followed by saxagliptin (n=), linagliptin (n=), alogliptin (n=), and vildagliptin (n=).
Postmarketing reports of AKI, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, have been received for patients treated with SGLT inhibitors including empagliflozin.
Some reports involved patients younger than  years old.
Empagliflozin:Frequency not reported: Increased serum creatinine, decreased eGFRPostmarketing reports: Acute kidney injury (AKI)
