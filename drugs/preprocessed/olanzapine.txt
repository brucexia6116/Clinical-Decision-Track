Commonly reported side effects of olanzapine include: asthenia, dizziness, drowsiness, extrapyramidal reaction, hyperkinesia, akinesia, cogwheel rigidity, drug-induced parkinson's disease, dyspepsia, mask-like face, and xerostomia.
Other side effects include: abnormal gait, back pain, constipation, fever, orthostatic hypotension, weight gain, myoclonus, and personality disorder.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, olanzapine may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some olanzapine side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Post-Injection delirium/sedation syndrome, a collection of signs and symptoms consistent with olanzapine overdose has been reported following injections of the extended-release IM suspension.
Events occurred in less than  of injections and in approximately  of patients receiving injections for up to  months.
Onset of events ranged from soon after injection to greater than  hours later.
The majority of patients were hospitalized and some required supportive care, including intubation.
Two deaths have been reported occurring  to  days after receiving the appropriate dose of the extended-release IM suspension.
In these patients, very high olanzapine blood levels were reported after death.
A study undertaken to determine the cause of the elevated drug levels in these  deaths provides inconclusive results.
As reported in a -- drug safety communication issued by the US Food and Drug Administration, a study in animals found much of the drug level increases could have occurred after death, but the possibility that the deaths were caused by a rapid, but delayed entry of the drug in to the bloodstream could not be ruled out.
Seizures occurred in  of patients receiving the IM extended-release suspension and  of patients receiving oral olanzapine.
Somnolence was reported in  of patients receiving IM extended-release suspension.
Sedation was reported in up to  of adolescents receiving this drug in short term schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder clinical trials.
When stopping abruptly, discontinuation symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting, have been reported.
Very common ( or more): Somnolence (up to ), headache (up to ), sedation (up to ), dizziness (up to )Common ( to ): Post-Injection Delirium/Sedation Syndrome, dysarthria, tremor, hypertonia, abnormal gait, parkinsonismUncommon ( to ): Seizures, cerebrovascular accident, ataxia, stupor, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, amnesiaRare (less than ): Coma, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, discontinuation symptoms
Very common ( or more): Orthostatic hypotensionCommon ( to ): ECG QT-corrected interval prolonged, hypertension, postural hypotension, chest pain, tachycardia, peripheral edemaUncommon ( to ): Syncope-related events, vasodilation, bradycardiaRare (less than ): Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, sudden deathPostmarketing reports: Venous thromboembolic events
Collective data gathered from  placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine, for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death  to  times greater in the drug treated patient than in the placebo treated patient.
The average length of duration for the trials was  weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (, pneumonia) in nature.
Olanzapine is not approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.
Very common ( or more): Increased weight (up to ), increased appetite (up to ) Common ( to ): Elevated cholesterol, elevated glucose, elevated triglyceridesFrequency not reported: Hyperglycemia associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or deathPostmarketing reports: Diabetic coma, diabetic ketoacidosis
Olanzapine appears to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics for increasing glucose levels.
Mean increases of up to  mg/dL have been reported.
The differences in mean changes in serum glucose were higher in patients with evidence of glucose dysregulation at baseline.
In an analysis of patients who completed  to  months of therapy, the rate on increase in mean blood glucose slowed after approximately  months.
Clinically significant alterations in lipids have been observed including serum triglyceride elevations greater than  mg/dL.
In long-term studies of at least -weeks in adults, increased from baseline in mean fasting cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides were  mg/dL,  mg/dL, and  mg/dL, respectively.
Mean increases in fasting lipid values (total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides) were greater in patients without evidence of lipid dysregulation at baseline.
In  placebo-controlled monotherapy trials, olanzapine-treated patients gained an average of  kg compared to an average  kg weight loss in placebo patients;  gained at least  of their baseline weight,  at least  of their baseline (compared to  and  in placebo).
Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline BMIs.
With longer term exposure (at least  weeks), weight gain of , , or  or more were reported in , , and , respectively.
Weight gain and increased appetite were reported in  and  of adolescents receiving this drug in short term schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder clinical trials (n=; placebo patients reported both events at a rate of ).
Very common ( or more): Dry mouth (up to ), constipation (up to ), dyspepsia (up to )Common ( to ): Abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, toothache, vomiting, toothache Uncommon ( to ): Tongue edemaRare (less than ): Ileus, intestinal obstructionPostmarketing reports: Pancreatitis
Nausea and dry mouth have been reported to be dose related.
A  year old man developed fecal incontinence following initiation of treatment with olanzapine  mg daily.
This effect continued until the patient's next scheduled exam, at approximately  days after initiation of therapy, at which point olanzapine was discontinued.
Fecal incontinence resolved within approximately  hours.
No organic cause for fecal incontinence was determined, rectal exam was negative, sigmoidoscopy results were normal, and lab tests were all within normal limits.
Common ( to ): Increased hepatic enzymesUncommon ( to ): Alkaline phosphatase increases, bilirubinemia, hypoproteinemia Rare (less than ): Fatty liver depositPostmarketing reports: Jaundice
Transient, asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminases were commonly seen, especially early in treatment.
Common ( to ): Nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, nasal congestion, pharyngolaryngeal pain, sneezing, rhinitis, pharyngitis, pneumoniaUncommon ( to ): EpistaxisRare (less than ): Lung edema
Very common ( or more): hyperprolactinemiaUncommon ( to ): Decreased libido, breast pain
In clinical studies, changes in prolactin levels were found to be statistically significantly different based on dose, higher doses were associated with higher levels of prolactin.
In a study of up to  weeks, plasma prolactin concentrations exceeded the upper limit of normal (ULN) in approximately  of patients who had normal baseline prolactin values.
The majority of these elevations were mild, and remained below  x ULN.
Common ( to ): Ecchymosis, eosinophilia, leukopenia, neutropeniaUncommon ( to ): Thrombocytopenia
Uncommon ( to ): Dry eyes, abnormality of accommodation, amblyopiaRare (less than ): Mydriasis

Very common ( or more): Insomnia (up to )Common ( to ): Abnormal dreams, auditory hallucination, restlessness, sleep disorder, abnormal thinking, personality disorder, insomniaUncommon ( to ): Personality disorder, suicide attempt
For the collection of adverse reactions, the term personality disorder was used to collect data on nonaggressive objectionable behavior.
The most common adverse reactions associated with the immediate-release products were postural hypotension, constipation, weight gain, dizziness, personality disorder, and akathisia.
The most common adverse reactions associated with the extended-release IM injection included headache, sedation, weight gain, cough, diarrhea, back pain, nausea, somnolence, dry mouth, nasopharyngitis, increased appetite, and vomiting.
Common ( to ): Injection site painRare (less than ): Injection site abscess
