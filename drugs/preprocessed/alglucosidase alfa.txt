Commonly reported side effects of alglucosidase alfa include: bradycardia, cough, fever, infusion related reaction, oxygen desaturation, skin rash, tachycardia, tachypnea, urticaria, vomiting, and flushing.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most common side effects were hypersensitivity reactions, fever, diarrhea, rash, vomiting, cough, pneumonia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, and decreased oxygen saturation.
The most serious side effects were anaphylactic reactions, acute cardiorespiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
The most common serious side effects were pneumonia, respiratory failure, respiratory distress, catheter-related infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, gastroenteritis, and fever.
The most common side effects that required intervention in clinical trials in infantile-onset and juvenile-onset Pompe disease were hypersensitivity reactions  and included rash, pyrexia, urticaria, flushing, decreased oxygen saturation, cough, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension/increased blood pressure, pallor, rigors, vomiting, cyanosis, agitation, and tremor.
These side effects occurred more often with higher infusion rates.

Delayed-onset hypersensitivity reactions (defined as side effects occurring  to  hours after infusion) included hyperhidrosis, fatigue, myalgia, and nausea.
Hypersensitivity reactions in infantile-onset Pompe disease patients included livedo reticularis, irritability, retching, increased lacrimation, ventricular extrasystoles, nodal rhythm, rales, respiratory tract irritation, and cold sweat.
Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions (included anaphylactic shock, respiratory failure, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, hypoxia, dyspnea, wheezing, convulsions, peripheral coldness, restlessness, nervousness, back pain, stridor, pharyngeal edema, abdominal pain, apnea, muscle spasm, conjunctivitis) have been reported during postmarketing experience.

Infusion reactions were reported more often in antibody-positive patients, especially those with high antibody titers.
Recurrent reactions consisting of influenza-like illness or a combination of events (, pyrexia, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, pain, fatigue) after infusion generally lasted for  to  days.
Severe and serious infusion reactions (including cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, apnea, stridor, pharyngeal edema, peripheral edema, chest pain, chest discomfort, muscle spasm, fatigue, conjunctivitis) have been reported during postmarketing experience.
