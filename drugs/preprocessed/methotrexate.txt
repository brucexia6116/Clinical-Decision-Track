Generally, the incidence and severity of acute side effects are related to dose and frequency of administration.
The most frequently reported adverse reactions include ulcerative stomatitis, leukopenia, nausea, abdominal distress, malaise, undue fatigue, chills and fever, dizziness, and decreased resistance to infection.
Uncommon ( to ): DysuriaRare ( to ): Oliguria, anuria, azotemiaVery rare (less than ): ProteinuriaFrequency not reported: Cystitis, hematuria
Common ( to ): Leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemiaUncommon ( to ): Pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, hematopoietic disordersRare ( to ): Megaloblastic anemia Very rare (less than ): Severe bone marrow depression, aplastic anemia, lymphadenopathy, lymphoproliferative disorders (partly reversible), eosinophilia, neutropenia Frequency not reported: Hemorrhage, hematoma, myelosuppression
Preexisting myelosuppression or low hematologic cell counts are contraindications to the use of this drug, particularly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis.
Close monitoring of the CBC is mandatory.
Profound count nadirs may require therapy discontinuation, at least temporarily.
Folate therapy and/or leucovorin rescue may be preventive or palliative.
Treated patients who become febrile should be assumed to have neutropenia until proven otherwise.
Cytopenia occurs in  to  of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who receive long-term therapy.
Risk factors include renal dysfunction, preexisting folate deficiency, increased mean corpuscular volume value, advanced age, concomitant use of other anti-folate medications (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and possibly hypoalbuminemia, concomitant infection, history of bone marrow injury, surgery, and concurrent use of NSAIDs or probenecid.
Pancytopenia is rarely observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
Bone marrow recovery typically occurs within two weeks after the withdrawal of MTX.
Very common ( or more): Increase in liver related enzymes (ALAT, ASAT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and LDH levels) is commonly reported but usually resolves within one month after cessation of therapyUncommon ( to ): Development of liver fattening, fibrosis and cirrhosis (occurs frequently despite regularly monitored, normal values of liver enzymes), drop of serum albuminRare ( to ): Acute hepatitis, hepatotoxicity Very rare (less than ): Reactivation of chronic hepatitis, acute liver degeneration, liver insufficiency, liver failure, liver atrophy, necrosis
Methotrexate can cause acute elevations of liver function tests (elevated serum transaminases in  of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on low-dose therapy) or chronic hepatotoxicity (fibrosis and cirrhosis).
The incidence of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with RA (low doses) averages  to  and , respectively.
Meta-analysis has revealed the incidence of progression of liver disease (worsening of  grade on the histologic classification of Roenigk) in patients with RA or psoriatic arthritis averages , or  per gram of MTX (total dose) given.
Chronic hepatotoxicity typically develops only after chronic use of higher doses ( years or more of total doses of  grams or more), is more likely in patients who ingest ethanol, who are aged, who are obese, who have chronic renal insufficiency, or who have diabetes.
In general, the following serve as guidelines for patients with non-oncologic conditions:)  Screen all patients to be treated with complete liver blood tests (transaminases, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin), hepatitis B and C serologic studies (some experts recommend viral serology's only in patients with abnormal liver function tests), baseline serum creatinine and complete blood count (CBC);)  Baseline liver biopsy if the patient has preexisting liver disease, persistently abnormal baseline AST (aspartate aminotransferase), history of excessive alcohol consumption (greater than  drinks/day), or chronic hepatitis B or C infection;)  Monitor hepatic enzymes every  to  weeks (with the understanding that they are not necessarily predictive of fibrosis/cirrhosis), discontinuing MTX if serum transaminase levels meet or exceed  to x baseline (some guidelines recommend withholding MTX for  to  weeks if significant abnormalities persist);)  Liver biopsy should be considered if significant hepatic enzyme abnormalities persist for  to  months.
Liver biopsy should be performed if  of  monthly AST levels are above the upper limit of normal or serum albumin levels are less than normal in the setting of well controlled disease;)  If liver biopsy shows Roenigk grade I, II, or IIIA (mild fibrosis), MTX may be resumed with monitoring as described above; if liver biopsy show Roenigk grade IIIB (moderate fibrosis) or IV (cirrhosis), MTX should be discontinued;)  MTX should be discontinued in patients with significant liver abnormalities, as described above, who refuse liver biopsy;)  It is still debated whether post-therapy biopsy should be performed every  to  years or after each  to  grams cumulative dose given, regardless of liver chemistries.
*Pre-biopsy coagulation studies and withholding of aspirin and other NSAIDs are recommended.
Uncommon ( to ): Allergic vasculitis, severe allergic reactions progressing to anaphylactic shock
Common ( to ): Disseminated herpes zoster, pneumocystis carinii pneumoniaVery rare (less than ): Immunosuppression, hypogammaglobulinemia, sepsis, opportunistic infections (may be fatal in some cases), infections caused by the cytomegalic virus, acute paronychiaFrequency not reported: Nocardiosis, cryptococcus mycosis, disseminated herpes simplex, listeria meningitis, mycobacterium avium, intracellular pneumonia, systemic fungal infections (, cryptococcosis, nocardiosis, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis), sepsis, decreased resistance to infection, pneumocystis jiroveci, pneumonia (most common infection), respiratory tract infection, cutaneous bacterial infections, pneumonia, reactivation of hepatitis B infection, worsening of hepatitis C infection
New and/or opportunistic infection can arise during or after therapy with methotrexate due to drug-induced immune suppression.
Infections during MTX therapy may occur in up to  of patients during low-dose therapy (as in RA).
Patients are at great risk after high-dose therapy.
MTX should be held prior to and during elective surgery to minimize the risk of infectious complications.
Limited data have shown that the use of low-dose MTX for patients with rheumatoid arthritis is associated with decreased CD and naive CD T lymphocytes after only  weeks of therapy.
Methotrexate is usually contraindicated in patients with overt or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency syndromes.
Immunization may be ineffective when given during methotrexate therapy.
Immunization with live virus vaccines is generally not recommended.
There have been reports of disseminated vaccinia infections after smallpox immunization in patients receiving methotrexate therapy.
