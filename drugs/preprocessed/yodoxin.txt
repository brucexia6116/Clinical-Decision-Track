As well as its needed effects, iodoquinol (the active ingredient contained in Yodoxin) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.

If any of the following side effects occur while taking iodoquinol, check with your doctor immediately:
Some iodoquinol side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and pruritus ani.
Some neuropathy may be irreversible.
Seizures and encephalopathy have been reported in at least one patient.
Optic atrophy has been reported, generally in children being treated for acrodermatitis enteropathica at daily dosages between 1300 to 3600 mg for up to two years.
Visual deterioration is generally irreversible.
Clioquinol, another hydroxyquinoline, was associated with several thousand cases of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy in Japan, leading to its removal from the market.
This syndrome consisted of peripheral weakness, spastic paraparesis, dysesthesia, and optic neuropathy.
Because of the neurotoxicity associated with iodoquinol (the active ingredient contained in Yodoxin) and its growing use in pediatric patients for the treatment of nonspecific chronic diarrhea in the 1970's, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs issued a statement recommending that products containing clioquinol or iodoquinol not be used in pediatric patients.
Nervous system side effects have been reported rarely.
These have included peripheral neuropathy and headache.
Optic atrophy has been reported, generally in pediatric patients receiving large doses for long periods of time.
Dermatologic side effects have included acneiform papular or pustular skin eruptions, bulla, urticaria, and pruritus.
These reactions are related to the iodine content of iodoquinol (the active ingredient contained in Yodoxin) 
Other side effects have included fever, chills, and enlargement of the thyroid.
It is possible that some side effects of Yodoxin may not have been reported.
These can be reported to the FDA here.
Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
