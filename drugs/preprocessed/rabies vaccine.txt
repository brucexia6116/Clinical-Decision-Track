Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction:  hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.

Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine.
When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.
Becoming infected with rabies is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine.
However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.
Call your doctor at once if you have rare but serious side effects, such as:
a very high fever;
fever, vomiting, skin rash, joint pain, general ill feeling;
tingling or a prickly feeling in your fingers or toes; 
weakness or unusual feeling in your arms and legs; or
problems with balance or eye movement, trouble speaking or swallowing.
Common side effects may include:
pain, swelling, itching, or redness where the shot was given;
headache;
dizziness;
muscle pain; or
nausea, stomach pain.
This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
