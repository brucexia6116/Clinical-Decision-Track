Other dosage forms:
The most commonly reported adverse reactions include skin rash, diarrhea, nausea, alkaline phosphatase, and transaminase elevation.
Skin rash is one of the most common adverse reactions and may occur at any time during treatment.
Some skin reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal.
In patients with the most severe reactions, systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, arthralgia, cholestatic jaundice, eosinophilia and mild leukocytosis, or leukopenia accompany the rash.
Among  patients with gout who received this drug for an average of  year ( to  months),  developed pruritic maculopapular skin eruptions, sometimes scaly or exfoliative.
The incidence of skin rash appears to be greater in patients with renal insufficiency.
Angioedema has been reported with and without signs and symptoms of a more generalized hypersensitivity reaction.
Skin reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and/or eosinophilia resembling Stevens-Johnson and/or Lyell syndromes have occurred rarely.
Associated vasculitis and tissue responses may manifest as hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and very rarely epilepsy.

Generalized hypersensitivity including skin reactions associated with exfoliation, fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, and/or eosinophilia resembling Stevens-Johnson and/or Lyell syndromes have occurred rarely.
Associated vasculitis and tissue responses may manifest as hepatitis, interstitial nephritis, and very rarely epilepsy.
When generalized hypersensitivity reactions have occurred, renal and or/hepatic disorders have often been present, particularly when the outcome has been fatal.
Angioedema has been reported with and without signs and symptoms of a more generalized hypersensitivity reaction.

Uncommon ( to ): Increase in acute gout attacksVery rare (less than ): Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemiaFrequency not reported: Hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, electrolyte abnormality, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, water intoxication, hypomagnesemia
Early clinical experience with this drug found acute gouty attacks on therapy initiation to be one of the more commonly observed adverse reactions; however, current use analyses suggests this incidence is now less than .
The reason for this change has not been determined, but it may be due to patients initiating therapy more gradually.
