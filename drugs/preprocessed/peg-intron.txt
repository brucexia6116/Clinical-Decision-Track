As well as its needed effects, peginterferon alfa-2b (the active ingredient contained in PegIntron) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.

If any of the following side effects occur while taking peginterferon alfa-2b, check with your doctor immediately:
Some peginterferon alfa-2b side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Nearly all study patients experienced at least 1 side effect.
The most common side effects associated with the product used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC), with or without ribavirin, have included headache, myalgia, fatigue/asthenia, injection site inflammation/reaction, emotional lability/irritability, nausea, rigors, and fevers.
Chills, insomnia, anemia, alopecia, anorexia, weight loss, and rash were also reported very commonly with peginterferon alfa-2b (the active ingredient contained in PegIntron) ribavirin.
Serious side effects associated with this drug (with or without ribavirin) have been reported in about 12% of subjects during clinical trials.
The most common serious side effects associated with peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin were depression and suicidal ideation in less than 1% of subjects.
The most common fatal side effects associated with this combination were cardiac arrest, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt in less than 1% of subjects.
In most cases, side effects resolved upon discontinuation of therapy.
During clinical trials, 10% to 15% of CHC patients discontinued therapy due to side effects.
The most common side effects associated with the product used for adjuvant treatment of melanoma have included fatigue, increased ALT, increased AST, pyrexia, headache, anorexia, myalgia, nausea, chills, and injection site reaction.
The most common serious side effects were fatigue, increased ALT, increased AST, and pyrexia.
During a clinical trial, 33% of melanoma patients discontinued therapy due to side effects.
Decreased neutrophil counts (alone: 70%; with ribavirin: 85%), anemia (with ribavirin: up to 35%), neutropenia (alone: 6%; with ribavirin: up to 31%), thrombocytopenia (alone: 7%; with ribavirin: 5%), and leukopenia (alone: less than 1%; with ribavirin: up to 10%) have been reported in CHC patients.
WHO grade 3 (21%) and WHO grade 4 (7%) neutropenia and hemoglobin levels below 100 g/L (up to 14%) were reported with peginterferon alfa-2b (the active ingredient contained in PegIntron) ribavirin.
Granulocytopenia (less than 0.
75 x 10[9]/L) was reported in 4% and 7% of patients using 0.
5 and 1 mcg/kg of peginterferon alfa-2b, respectively.
Thrombocytopenia (less than 70 x 10[9]/L) was reported in 1% and 3% of patients using 0.
5 and 1 mcg/kg of peginterferon alfa-2b, respectively.
Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred more often in hepatitis C virus (HCV)/HIV-coinfected patients.
Neutropenia (26%), decreased absolute neutrophil count levels (less than 500 cells/mm3: 4%), decreased platelets (less than 50,000/mm3: 4%), anemia (hemoglobin less than 9.
4 g/dL: 12%), and decreased CD4 lymphocytes (8%) were reported in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2b/ribavirin.
Anemia (all grades: 6%; grade 3/4: less than 1%) has been reported in melanoma patients.
A 48-year-old patient with multiple myeloma experienced severe bone marrow hypoplasia coincident with peginterferon alfa-2b therapy.
The patient was taking oral thalidomide for several months prior to adding peginterferon alfa-2b to her regimen; she developed a severe bone marrow hypoplasia while using both drugs.
Since she used thalidomide previously and this agent was never stopped, it would appear the peginterferon alfa-2b was responsible for the myelosuppression; however, a possible interaction between thalidomide and interferon alfa-2b cannot be ruled out.
