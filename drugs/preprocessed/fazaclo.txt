Common side effects of FazaClo include: hypotension, fever, tachycardia, constipation, dizziness, headache, nausea, sedation, vomiting, and weight gain.
Other side effects include: syncope, and diaphoresis.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most serious adverse reactions include agranulocytosis, seizure, cardiovascular effects, and fever.
The most common side effects include drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, tachycardia, constipation, and hypersalivation.
Common ( to ): Leukopenia/decreased WBC/neutropenia, leukocytosisUncommon ( to ): Eosinophilia, agranulocytosis Rare (less than ): AnemiaPostmarketing reports: Elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thrombocytosis, thrombocytopenia
During pre-marketing testing, the cumulative incidence of agranulocytosis at one year was reported to be .
Based on Clozaril National Registry (US patients) data collected up to April , a hematologic risk analysis found the incidence of agranulocytosis rises steeply during the first  months, peaks at approximately the third month, and decreases at  months of therapy; after  months the incidence decreases further, however, it never reaches zero.
Individuals with an initial episode of moderate leukopenia (WBC of at least /mm and less than /mm) are at an increased risk of having a subsequent episode of agranulocytosis.
In clinical trials, eosinophil counts of greater than /mm occurred in approximately  of patients.
Eosinophilia has been co-reported with some cases of myocarditis (approximately ) and pericarditis/pericardial effusion, although it is unknown whether eosinophilia is a reliable predictor of carditis.
Very common ( or more): Weight gain (up to )Rare (less than ): Diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose toleranceVery rare (less than ): Hyperosmolar coma, ketoacidosis, severe hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemiaPostmarketing reports: Hyperuricemia, hyponatremia, weight loss
Pooled data from  studies in patients with schizophrenia found the mean change in fasting blood glucose in clozapine treated patients was + mg/dL; pooled data from  studies revealed clozapine treatment was associated a mean increase of  mg/dl in total cholesterol; pooled data from  studies showed a weight gain of  or greater relative to baseline body weight occurred in  of patients with a mean weight gain of  kg.
Very common ( or more): Drowsiness/sedation , dizziness (up to ), headache Common ( to ): Tremor, syncope, hypokinesia/akinesia, seizures, rigidity, akathisia, vertigo, dysarthria, extrapyramidal symptoms Frequency not reported: Dystonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesiaPostmarketing reports: Delirium/abnormal EEG, myoclonus, paresthesia, possible cataplexy, status epilepticus, cholinergic syndrome
The cumulative incidence of seizure at  year is approximately  based on pre-marketing testing.
The risk is dose-related.
Extrapyramidal symptoms that occur appear to be milder and less frequent than other antipsychotic drugs.
There have been no reports of tardive dyskinesia directly attributable to clozapine; however, the syndrome has been reported in a few patients who were treated with other antipsychotics prior to receiving clozapine.
A causal relationship can neither be established nor excluded.
Very common ( or more): Salivation , hypersalivation (up to ), constipation (up to ), vomiting (up to ), nausea (up to ), dyspepsia (up to )Common ( to ): Dry mouth, abdominal discomfort/heartburn, diarrhea, anorexiaRare (less than ): DysphagiaVery rare (less than ): Ileus, parotid gland enlargement Postmarketing reports: Acute pancreatitis, dysphagia, salivary gland swelling, colitis
Very common ( or more): Tachycardia , hypotension , hypertension Common ( to ): ECG changesRare (less than ): Circulatory collapse, arrhythmia, myocarditis, pericarditis/pericardial effusionVery rare (less than ): Cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrestFrequency not reported: Deep vein thrombosisPostmarketing reports: Atrial or ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, QT interval prolongation, Torsades de pointes, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, chest pain/angina pectoris
Isolated cases of cardiac arrhythmias, pericarditis/pericardial effusion, and myocarditis have been reported.
Postmarketing, very rare events of ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, and QT prolongation which may be associated with Torsades de pointes have been observed, although there is no conclusive causal relationship to use of this drug.
Collective data gathered from  placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death  to  times greater in the drug-treated patient than in the placebo-treated patient.
The average length of duration for the trials was  weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (, pneumonia) in nature.
Although clozapine was not included in these studies, the consistent findings across all three relevant chemical classes support the opinion that these findings are likely to be applicable to all atypical antipsychotic agents.
Clozapine is not indicated for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.
