Some sildenafil side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:

This drug has lesser affinity for isoenzyme PDE, an enzyme found in the retina.
This lower selectivity is thought to be the basis for abnormalities related to color vision observed with higher doses or plasma levels.
Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy developed in one eye within minutes to hours after ingestion of sildenafil.
Four of the five patients had no vascular risk factors for ischemic optic neuropathy.
-Abnormal Vision: Mild to moderate and transient, predominantly color tinge to vision, but also increased sensitivity to light, or blurred vision.
-Visual color distortions: Chloropsia, chromatopsia, cyanopsia, erythropsia and xanthopsia -Lacrimation disorders: Dry eye, lacrimal disorder and lacrimation increased

Common ( to ): AnemiaFrequency not reported: LeukopeniaPostmarketing reports: In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (secondary to sickle cell disease) taking Revatio (R), vaso-occlusive crises requiring hospitalization were more commonly reported.
The clinical relevance of this finding in male patients treated with sildenafil for erectile dysfunction is unknown.
