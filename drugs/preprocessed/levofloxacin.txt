More frequently reported side effects include: diarrhea and insomnia.

WARNINGS: Levofloxacin may rarely cause tendon damage (such as tendinitis, tendon rupture) during or after treatment.
Your risk for tendon problems is greater if you are over  years of age, if you are taking corticosteroids (such as prednisone), or if you have had a kidney, heart or lung transplant.
Stop exercising, rest, and get medical help right away if you develop joint/muscle/tendon pain or swelling.
Levofloxacin should not be used in patients with myasthenia gravis.
It may cause the condition to become worse.
Seek immediate medical attention if you develop muscle weakness or trouble breathing.
