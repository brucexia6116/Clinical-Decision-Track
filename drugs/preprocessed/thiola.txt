As well as its needed effects, tiopronin (the active ingredient contained in Thiola) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some tiopronin side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Hepatic side effects have included jaundice and abnormal liver function tests.
Hypersensitivity side effects have included fever, rash (erythematous, maculopapular, or morbilliform), and pruritus.
Laryngeal edema, dyspnea, respiratory distress, chills, arthralgia, weakness and adenopathy have also been reported.
Patients experiencing immediate hypersensitivity reactions can be treated with antihistamines and tiopronin treatment restarted at a lower dose.
Those experiencing a rash later in treatment (at least  months into therapy) usually cannot be restarted on tiopronin.
Immunologic side effects have included a simulated lupus erythematous occasionally associated with a positive antinuclear antibody test.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included hypogeusia.
Nausea, emesis, diarrhea or soft stools, anorexia, abdominal pain, and bloating or flatulence have also been reported.
Metabolic side effects have rarely included vitamin B deficiency.
Dermatologic side effects have included wrinkling and friability of the skin.
Ecchymosis, urticaria, warts, pemphigus, and elastosis perforans serpiginosa have also been reported.
Hematological side effects have included increased bleeding, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and eosinophilia.
Renal side effects have included proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and hematuria.
Respiratory side effects have included pharyngitis, bronchiolitis, hemoptysis, and pulmonary infiltrates.
Nervous system side effects have included myasthenic syndrome.
It is possible that some side effects of Thiola may not have been reported.
These can be reported to the FDA here.
