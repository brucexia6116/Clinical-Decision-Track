Stools commonly become dark green or black when iron preparations are taken by mouth.
This is caused by unabsorbed iron and is harmless.
However, in rare cases, black stools of a sticky consistency may occur along with other side effects such as red streaks in the stool, cramping, soreness, or sharp pains in the stomach or abdominal area.
