Common side effects of Humulin R include: hypoglycemia.
Other side effects include: weight gain.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Frequency not reported: Transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder, worsening diabetic neuropathy
Transitory, reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder and worsening of diabetic retinopathy has been reported with insulin initiation and glucose control intensification.
Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk for diabetic neuropathy.
Uncommon ( to ): Lipodystrophy
Long-term use of insulin can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections.
Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy (thickening of adipose tissue) and lipoatrophy (thinning of adipose tissues).
Uncommon ( to ): Local reactions such as redness, swelling, or itching at the injection siteVery rare (less than ): Anaphylactic reactions
Hypersensitivity reactions have included both local and systemic reactions.
Anaphylaxis has been reported.
Local reactions have presented as erythema, local edema, and pruritus at the injection site.
Most minor reactions to insulin at the injection site resolve in a few days to a few weeks.
In some instances these reactions have been caused by other factors such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique.
Localized reactions have been reported with metacresol, which is an excipient in many insulin products.
Generalized allergy to insulin may present as a whole body rash, dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, or diaphoresis.
Increases in titers of anti-insulin antibodies that react with human insulin have been observed; some data indicates the increase is transient.
The clinical significance of these antibodies is unknown; it does not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control.
Frequency not reported: Formation of anti-insulin antibodies
Frequency not reported: Sodium retention and edema
Insulin may cause sodium retention and edema, especially with intensified insulin therapy.
Combination use with thiazolidinediones has resulted in fluid retention which has led to or exacerbated heart failure.
Adverse reactions reported with this insulin include hypoglycemia, allergic reactions, injection site reactions, lipodystrophy, weight gain, and edema
Very common ( or more): HypoglycemiaRare (less than ): Insulin resistanceFrequency not reported: Hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia
Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of all insulin therapies.
The timing of hypoglycemia generally reflects the time-action profile of the administered insulin, however, the time action profile of any insulin may vary considerably in different individuals or at different times in the same individual depending on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity.
Other factors such as changes in food intake (timing of meals, amount or type of food) and concomitant medications will also affect the risk of hypoglycemia.
Hypokalemia, which is due to a shift in potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space, occurs with all insulins.
Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia has been reported, particularly in patients treated for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
Insulin increases the intracellular transport of phosphate, which often results in hypophosphatemia during treatment of DKA.
In situations in which not enough insulin is available to control blood glucose, hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic non-ketotic syndrome may occur.
Injection site reactions including pain, redness, hives, inflammation, bruising, swelling, and itching have occurred.
These usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks; rotation of the injection site reduces the risk of these reactions developing.
Common ( to ): Injection site hypertrophyFrequency not reported: Injection site reactions
Frequency not reported: Acute painful peripheral neuropathy
Acute painful peripheral neuropathy has been reported with insulin initiation and glucose control intensification.
Over the long-term, improved glycemic control decreases the risk for neuropathy.
Weight gain can occur with insulin use; it is believed to be due to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria.
