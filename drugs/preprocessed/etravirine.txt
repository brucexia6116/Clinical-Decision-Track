The safety report of etravirine is based on  HIV--infected, treatment-experienced patients receiving  mg twice daily in combination with background regimen (BR).
The median exposure was  weeks.
Discontinuation due to side effects occurred in  of patients using etravirine.
The most common side effects of moderate to severe intensity reported with etravirine and BR, regardless of causality, were peripheral neuropathy and rash.
A total of  of HIV--infected patients in Phase  trials receiving etravirine discontinued due to rash.
Very common ( or more): Rash (all intensities: ; at least moderate intensity: )Common ( to ): Less than  (at least moderate intensity): Dry skin, face swelling, hyperhidrosis, lipohypertrophy, night sweats, prurigoUncommon ( to ): Erythema multiforme (at least moderate intensity: up to )Rare (less than ): Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiformeFrequency not reported: Contact dermatitis, erythema, pruritusPostmarketing reports: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (fatal cases)
During clinical trials, rash generally was mild to moderate, occurred chiefly in the second week of therapy, and was infrequent after the fourth week.
Rash usually resolved within  to  weeks on continued use of the drug.
The incidence of rash was higher in women taking etravirine (at least moderate severity: ) compared to men (at least moderate severity: ).
Discontinuation due to rash occurred in  of women compared to  of men.
Patients with a history of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-related rash did not appear to be at increased risk.
Erythema multiforme has been reported in no more than  of patients in other trials.
