Side effects include:
Use for anesthesia or MAC sedation: Bradycardia, arrhythmia, tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, movement, burning/stinging, pain at injection site, apnea, rash, pruritus.
Use for critical care setting sedation: Bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, hypotension, hyperlipidemia, respiratory acidosis (during weaning).
Very common ( or more): Hypotension (up to )Common ( to ): Hypertension, bradycardiaUncommon ( to ): Arrhythmias, tachycardia, extrasystoleRare ( to ): Pulmonary edema, asystole, syncope, perioperative arrhythmias, cardiac arrest Very rare (less than ): Cardiac failure, pulmonary edemaFrequency not reported: Cardiac arrhythmia
Very common ( or more): Pruritus (up to )Common ( to ): Transient flush, rash
Common ( to ): Nausea, vomitingVery rare (less than ): Pancreatitis, abdominal cramps
Rare (Less than ): Discoloration of the urine following prolonged use
Frequency not reported: Hepatomegaly
Rare ( to ): Anaphylaxis, in some cases with angioedema, bronchospasm, erythema, and hypotension (these reactions have been reported to respond to adrenaline)
Common ( to ): Pain during injection (burning, tingling/slinging)Very rare (less than ): Tissue necrosis following accidental extravascular administration
Very rare (less than ): Metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperlipidemia
Very rare (less than ): Rhabdomyolysis (when administered at doses greater than  mg/kg/hour for ICU sedation)
Very common ( or more): Paresthesia (up to ), excitation phenomena such as involuntary movements, twitches, tremors, hypertonus, hiccup Common ( to ): Headache, shiveringRare ( to ): Convulsions and seizures of the epileptic typeVery rare (less than ): Postoperative unconsciousnessFrequency not reported: Involuntary movements
Paresthesias (including burning, tingling, stinging) and/or pruritus, usually manifested in the perineal region, were the most frequently recorded adverse reactions in clinical trials.
Paresthesias and pruritus generally occurred within  minutes after administration of the initial dose and were generally transient and mild to moderate in intensity.
The pharmacologic basis of these sensory phenomena is unknown.
No pretreatments, including the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, or lidocaine, are known to have an effect on or to reduce the incidence of these sensations.
Very common ( or more): Hypoxemia (up to )Common ( to ): Procedural pain (bronchoscopy), transient apnea, coughVery rare (less than ): Pulmonary edema, hiccough
Very rare (less than ): Renal failure
Common ( to ): Thrombosis, phlebitis
