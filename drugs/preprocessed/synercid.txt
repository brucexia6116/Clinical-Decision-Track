See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, dalfopristin / quinupristin may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking dalfopristin / quinupristin, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
Some dalfopristin / quinupristin side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
In all  comparative studies, patients discontinued therapy with dalfopristin-quinupristin as compared to comparator for the following reasons: venous adverse events ( versus  comparator), rash ( versus  comparator), nausea ( versus  comparator), vomiting ( versus  comparator), pain ( versus  comparator), and pruritus ( versus  comparator).
In the  comparative studies for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), the side effect profile observed differed significantly from the profile observed in the other comparative studies.
In these  comparative cSSSI studies, patients discontinued therapy with dalfopristin-quinupristin as compared to comparator for the following reasons: venous adverse events ( versus  comparator), rash ( versus  comparator), nausea ( versus  comparator), vomiting ( versus  comparator), pain ( versus  comparator), and pruritus ( versus  comparator).
Venous adverse events were mainly observed in patients with peripheral infusions.
In noncomparative studies, approximately one-third of patients discontinued therapy due to side effects; however, the discontinuation rate due to side effects possibly or probably related to dalfopristin-quinupristin was about .
The side effects leading to therapy discontinuation included increased total bilirubin , increased conjugated bilirubin , treatment-related arthralgia , and treatment-related myalgia .
High baseline total and conjugated bilirubin levels were recorded in  and  of patients, respectively, prior to study entry.
In a study with  patients,  discontinued treatment due to side effects.
The most common side effects were arthralgia, myalgia, nausea, and rash.
Local side effects have frequently included inflammation at the infusion site (all comparative studies: ; comparative cSSSI studies: ), pain at the infusion site (all comparative studies: ; comparative cSSSI studies: ), infusion site edema (all comparative studies: ; comparative cSSSI studies: ), and infusion site reaction (all comparative studies: ; comparative cSSSI studies: ).
The manufacturer recommends flushing of the vein with  dextrose in water solution following each infusion of dalfopristin-quinupristin to minimize venous irritation.
Consideration should be given to changing the infusion site in patients with moderate to severe venous irritation.
Dalfopristin-quinupristin infusion (standard diluent volume of  mL) may also be further diluted ( to  mL) in these patients.
Venous adverse events occurred predominately in patients who had peripheral infusions; therefore, a peripherally inserted central catheter or a central venous catheter may be utilized in selected patients.
Some cases of arthralgia and myalgia noted improvement of symptoms with a reduction in dose frequency to every  hours.
Resolution of symptoms has been reported following discontinuation of dalfopristin-quinupristin.
One trial with  patients reported an incidence of  and , respectively, for arthralgia and myalgia.
Intravenous dalfopristin-quinupristin plus minocycline were associated with myalgia and arthralgia in  of neutropenic cancer patients (n=).

Mild cases of pseudomembranous enterocolitis may respond to discontinuation of dalfopristin-quinupristin alone.
Moderate to severe cases may require fluid replacement, electrolytes, protein supplementation, and antibiotics for treating C difficile.

Irrespective of relationship to dalfopristin-quinupristin, increased total bilirubin (greater than  times ULN; ) and conjugated bilirubin (greater than  times ULN; ) were reported during noncomparative studies.
Isolated hyperbilirubinemia (primarily conjugated bilirubin) can occur and is thought to be due to dalfopristin-quinupristin competing with bilirubin for excretion.
Hepatitis and jaundice have been reported in less than  of patients.
High baseline total and conjugated bilirubin levels were recorded in  and  of patients, respectively, prior to noncomparative study entry.
