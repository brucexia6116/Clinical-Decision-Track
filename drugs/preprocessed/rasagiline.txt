When used as an adjunct to levodopa, the risk for developing posttreatment high blood pressure, combined with a significant increase from baseline was higher for rasagiline (2%) compared to placebo (1%).
Clinical trial data suggest that orthostatic hypotension occurs more frequently during the first 2 months of rasagiline treatment and tends to decrease over time.
Postmarketing reports of elevated blood pressure, including rare incidents of hypertensive crisis associated with the ingestion of unknown amounts of tyramine-rich foods, have been reported in patients taking recommended doses of rasagiline.
Very common (10% or more): Orthostatic/postural hypotensionCommon (1% to 10%): Angina pectoris, first degree AV block, hypertension, peripheral edema, peripheral vascular disorderUncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Myocardial infarctionPostmarketing reports: Hypertensive crisis (after ingestion of unknown amounts of tyramine-rich foods)Frequency not reported: Arrhythmia, blood pressure fluctuations, bradycardia, bundle branch block, cardiovascular disorder, complete AV block, heart arrest, pallor, palpitation, second degree AV block, thrombosis, vasodilatation, vascular disorder, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles
Very common (10% or more): Dizziness, dyskinesia, headacheCommon (1% to 10%): Ataxia, balance disorder, carpal tunnel syndrome, dystonia, paresthesiaUncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Cerebrovascular accident, somnolenceFrequency not reported: Hyperkinesias, myoclonus, nystagmus, speech disorder, withdrawal-emergent hyperpyrexia and confusion resembling neuroleptic malignant syndromePostmarketing reports: Serotonin syndrome
Dyskinesia or exacerbation of dyskinesia has been reported when rasagiline is used as an adjunct to levodopa.
A dose reduction of levodopa may mitigate this effect.
Cases of patients treated with rasagiline and other dopaminergic medications falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living including the operations of motor vehicles, have been reported and sometimes resulted in accidents.
Some of these cases of somnolence have been reported more than 1 year after initiation of treatment.
The postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome, associated with agitation, confusion, rigidity, pyrexia, and myoclonus have been reported by patients treated with antidepressants/SNRI concomitantly with rasagiline.
The symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome, with symptoms included elevated temperature, muscular rigidity, altered consciousness, and autonomic instability, has been reported with rapid dose reduction, and withdrawal of, or changes in, drugs that increase central dopaminergic tone.
Common (1% to 10%): Abnormal dreams, depression, hallucinations, insomnia, sleep disorderUncommon (0.
1% to 1%): ConfusionFrequency not reported: Paranoid reactions, personality disorderPostmarketing reports: Impulse control disorders, new or worsening mental status and behavioral changes including psychotic-like behavior
When studied as an adjunct to levodopa, the incidence of hallucinations was approximately 5% at a rasagiline dose of 0.
5 mg per day, 4% at 1 mg per day, and 3% with placebo.
Dose reduction or treatment discontinuation should be considered if hallucinations or psychotic-like behaviors develop.
Reduced impulse control or increased compulsive behaviors include intense urges to gamble, increased sexual urges, intense urges to spend money, and binge eating.
Patients may not recognize these behaviors as abnormal.
Dose reduction or treatment discontinuation should be considered if such urges develop.
Very common (10% or more): Accidental injury, fallCommon (1% to 10%): Fever, hernia, infection, malaise, otitis media, pain, sweating, vertigoFrequency not reported: Chills, dysautonomia, prolonged immobilization
Common (1% to 10%): Alopecia, cellulitis, contact dermatitis, dermatitis, ecchymosis, rash Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Vesiculobullous rashFrequency not reported: Abscesses, dry skin, gangrene, nail disorder, pruritus, psoriasis, skin ulcer, urticaria
Common (1% to 10%): Benign skin neoplasm, melanoma, skin carcinomaFrequency not reported: Bladder carcinoma, breast neoplasm, cyst, Kaposi's sarcoma
Frequency not reported: Goiter, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
Very common (10% or more): NauseaCommon (1% to 10%): Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, flatulence, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, tooth disorder, vomitingFrequency not reported: Colitis, dysphagia, eructation, esophagitis, fecal impaction, gastritis, gastrointestinal disorder, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, halitosis, intestinal obstruction, megacolon, mouth ulceration, periodontitis
Common (1% to 10%): Albuminuria, decreased libido, impotence, urinary urgencyFrequency not reported: Anuria, breast pain, dysmenorrhea, dysuria, nocturia, prostate-specific antigen increase, testis disorder, urogenital anomaly, vaginal hemorrhage

1% to 1%): AnemiaFrequency not reported: Eosinophilia, leukocytosis, megaloblastic anemia, thrombocytopenia
Frequency not reported: Abnormal liver function tests
Common (1% to 10%): Allergy
Common (1% to 10%): Flu syndrome, influenza, fungal infectionFrequency not reported: Sepsis, herpes simplex

Common (1% to 10%): Arthralgia, arthritis, back pain, joint disorder, musculoskeletal pain, myasthenia, neck pain, tendon disorder, tenosynovitisFrequency not reported: Bursitis, leg cramps, myositis, rhabdomyolysis following fall, spinal stenosis, tendinous contracture
Common (1% to 10%): Abnormal vision, conjunctivitisFrequency not reported: Blindness, diplopia, eye disorder, eye hemorrhage, glaucoma, vitreous disorder
