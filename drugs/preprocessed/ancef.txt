Common ( to ): Diarrhea, vomiting, nauseaUncommon ( to ): Oral candidiasis (oral thrush)Very rare (less than ): Anal pruritus, pseudomembranous colitisFrequency not reported: Mouth ulcers, abdominal/stomach cramps, epigastric pain, heartburn, flatus, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, colitisCephalosporin-class:Frequency not reported: Colitis, abdominal pain
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite were usually of moderate severity and frequently resolved during or after therapy.
Oral candidiasis has been reported during prolonged therapy.
The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms has been reported during or after antibacterial therapy.
Common ( to ): Loss of appetiteRare ( to ): Increased blood glucose level/hyperglycemia, decreased blood glucose level/hypoglycemiaFrequency not reported: Anorexia
Common ( to ): Pain at IM injection site (sometimes with induration)Uncommon ( to ): Thrombophlebitis with IV administrationFrequency not reported: Phlebitis at injection site, induration
Uncommon ( to ): Erythema, erythema multiforme, exanthema, urticaria, angioedema (reversible local permeability of blood vessels, joints, mucous membranes)Rare ( to ): Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell's syndrome), Stevens-Johnson syndromeFrequency not reported: Pruritus, skin rash, fixed drug eruptions, pustular skin eruptions, contact dermatitisCephalosporin-class:-Frequency not reported: Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis
A case of occupational contact dermatitis due to cephalosporin allergy has been reported in a nurse who prepared cephalosporin solutions for administration to patients.
The dermatitis resolved after the nurse stopped preparing the solutions.
Uncommon ( to ): SeizuresRare ( to ): Dizziness, vertigo, hyperactivity, drowsiness, epileptogenic activityFrequency not reported: Fainting, lightheadedness, somnolence, headache, encephalopathy (symptoms included tonic-clonic seizures, lethargy, disorientation, memory loss, asterixis, multifocal myoclonus)Cephalosporin-class:-Frequency not reported: Hyperactivity, hypertonia
Seizures have been reported when inappropriately high doses were administered to patients with renal dysfunction (CrCl less than  mL/min).
Encephalopathy has been reported in patients with renal failure.
Toxicity was due to increased drug serum levels and increased permeability of blood-brain barrier caused by uremia.
Uncommon ( to ): Drug-induced feverRare ( to ): Malaise, fatigue, weakness, hot flushes, chest pain, increased LDH, increased alkaline phosphataseVery rare (less than ): Face edemaFrequency not reported: TirednessCephalosporin-class:-Frequency not reported: Elevated LDH, superinfection, false-positive test for urinary glucose
Uncommon ( to ): Interstitial pneumonia/pneumonitisRare ( to ): Pleural effusion, dyspnea, respiratory distress, cough, rhinitis
Risk factors for coagulation disorders have included insufficient vitamin K or other blood clotting factors, artificial nutrition, poor diet, liver or renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, and disorders/diseases that cause bleeding (, hemophilia, stomach ulcers, duodenal ulcers).
A -year-old hemodialysis patient with a coagulase-positive staphylococcal arteriovenous fistula graft infection was found to have a hematoma and increased thrombin, prothrombin, and partial thromboplastin times after receiving  g IV followed by  g every  hours for  days.
The laboratory changes resolved after therapy was stopped, but recurred when this drug was reinstituted.
Rare ( to ): Neutropenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, leukocytosis, granulocytosis, monocytosis, lymphocytopenia, basophilia, eosinophiliaVery rare (less than ): Coagulation (blood clotting) disorders, bleeding, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, anemia, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, hemolytic anemiaFrequency not reported: Thrombocythemia, hematoma, increased thrombin time, increased prothrombin time, increased partial thromboplastin time, positive direct and indirect Coombs testsCephalosporin-class:-Frequency not reported: Aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, prolonged prothrombin time, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis
Transient increases in AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin, LDH, and alkaline phosphatase have been reported.
Rare ( to ): Increased AST, increased ALT, increased GGT, increased bilirubin, hepatitis (transient), cholestatic jaundice (transient)Cephalosporin-class:Frequency not reported: Hepatic dysfunction (including cholestasis), elevated bilirubin
Transient increases in BUN were generally reported in patients using other potentially nephrotoxic agents concomitantly.
Rare ( to ): Nephrotoxicity, interstitial nephritis, undefined nephropathy, increased BUN (transient)Frequency not reported: Increased creatinine levels, renal failure, increased serum ureaCephalosporin-class:-Frequency not reported: Renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, increased creatinine, interstitial nephritis (reversible fever, azotemia, pyuria, eosinophiluria; with some cephalosporins)
Rare ( to ): Vaginitis, genital candidiasis (moniliasis), proteinuriaVery rare (less than ): Genital pruritusFrequency not reported: Vulvar pruritus
Rare ( to ): Nightmares, nervousness/anxiety, insomnia, confusion
Rare ( to ): Disturbed color vision
Very rare (less than ): Anaphylactic shock (including swelling of larynx with narrowing of airways, increased heart rate, shortness of breath, falling blood pressure, swollen tongue)Frequency not reported: Anaphylaxis, allergic reaction (including eosinophilia, urticaria, itching, drug fever, skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome), allergic cross-sensitivityCephalosporin-class:-Frequency not reported: Allergic reactions, serum sickness-like reaction
Frequency not reported: Hypotension
