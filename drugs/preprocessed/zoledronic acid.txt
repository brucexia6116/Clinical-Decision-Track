Commonly reported side effects of zoledronic acid include: hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.
Other side effects include: hypocalcemia.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, zoledronic acid may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.

If any of the following side effects occur while taking zoledronic acid, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
Some zoledronic acid side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
In general, side effects have been mild and transient and similar to other bisphosphonates.
Acute phase reactions have occurred within three days after administration of this drug with symptoms of pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness.
Symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution can take up to 7 to 14 days, and some symptoms have persisted for a longer duration.

1%): Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures (bisphosphonate class adverse reaction)Postmarketing reports: Muscle cramps; osteonecrosis of the jaw, hip, and femur have been reported predominantly in cancer patients treated with intravenous bisphosphonates (many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids which may be a risk factor for ONJ).
Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily of the jaws) have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients taking this drug.
Many of these patients had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental surgeries.
Osteonecrosis of the jaws has multiple documented risk factors including a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.

chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids) and co-morbid conditions (e.
