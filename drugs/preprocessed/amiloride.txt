If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking amiloride, get emergency help immediately:
Cases of severe hyponatremia have been reported during hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride therapy.
In  cases, the patients subsequently did well with hydrochlorothiazide and potassium supplementation, suggesting a significant role for amiloride in the development of their hyponatremia.
Significantly elevated serum uric acid, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels have been associated with combination hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride therapy.
These metabolic abnormalities may not be due to amiloride since they are reported during hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy.
Amiloride is known to cause significant elevations in serum aldosterone, renin, and angiotensin II levels.
Metabolic side effects are the most common.
Amiloride may cause hyperkalemia in up to  of patients, although the risk is decreased to about  to  when thiazide or loop diuretics are coadministered.
Patients with diabetes or who are on other potassium-sparing therapy, ACE inhibitors, or potassium supplementation are predisposed to amiloride-induced hyperkalemia.
Renal side effects including renal insufficiency is unusual after amiloride monotherapy because it is only a weak diuretic.
Gastrointestinal complaints of diarrhea, nausea, constipation, anorexia, and general abdominal pain occur less than  of patients.
Nervous system side effects occur in less than  of patients, and include headache, weakness, and fatigue.
Encephalopathy may be induced by amiloride-associated metabolic changes in some patients with severe liver disease.
Cardiovascular side effects are mainly limited to the increased risk of hyperkalemia-induced arrhythmias in patients at risk for arrhythmias.
Angina pectoris, arrhythmias, and orthostatic hypotension are reported in less than  of patients.
Genitourinary problems include rare complaints of impotence.
Polyuria and urinary frequency are reported in less than  of patients.
