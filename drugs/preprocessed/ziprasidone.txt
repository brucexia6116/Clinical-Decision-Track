Commonly reported side effects of ziprasidone include: drowsiness, weight gain, dizziness, headache, and nausea.
Other side effects include: respiratory tract disease, extrapyramidal reaction, orthostatic hypotension, weight gain, and pain at injection site.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, ziprasidone may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some ziprasidone side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:

Weight gain of  or more was statistically significantly greater among patients with schizophrenia receiving ziprasidone in a pooled analysis of four  and  week placebo-controlled trials ( versus ).
The median weight gain was  kg among all ziprasidone patients compared with no weight gain in the placebo patients.

Collective data gathered from  placebo-controlled clinical studies (n=) involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents for the treatment of behavioral disorders in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death  to  times greater in the drug-treated patient than in the placebo-treated patient.
The average length of duration for the trials was  weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (, pneumonia) in nature.
Although ziprasidone was not included in these studies, the consistent findings across all three relevant chemical classes support the opinion that these findings are likely to be applicable to all atypical antipsychotic agents.
Ziprasidone is not approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.

In a study evaluating the QT prolonging effect of oral ziprasidone with other drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia, the mean increase in QTc from baseline ranged from  to  seconds which was greater than  of the comparator drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol) but was approximately  seconds less than thioridazine.
