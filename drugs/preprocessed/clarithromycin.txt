Hepatic dysfunction (sometimes severe and usually reversible), including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic hepatitis, with or without jaundice have been reported.
In some instances, hepatic failure with fatal outcome has been reported and generally has been associated with serious underlying diseases (, preexisting liver disease) and/or concomitant medications (, hepatotoxic agents).
Drug-induced hepatotoxicity was rare and typically associated with higher doses ( to  g/day) and high serum drug levels.
The enzyme elevation pattern was usually cholestatic with minimal elevations of AST and ALT.

Allergic reactions have ranged from urticaria and mild skin eruptions to rare cases of anaphylaxis.
A -year-old female admitted for heart failure and a right upper lobe infiltrate was started on clarithromycin  mg.
The following day, this drug was discontinued and IV antibiotics were initiated due to persisting fever.
She received only  dose of this drug.
On day  of the hospitalization, the patient was afebrile, IV antibiotics were stopped, and this drug was again started.
Two hours after the dose, the patient developed swelling in her lips, jaw, tongue, mouth, and face.
The patient was given diphenhydramine and the clarithromycin was discontinued.
She was discharged the following day.
