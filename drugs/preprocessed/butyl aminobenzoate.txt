The most common adverse reaction caused by local anesthetics is contact dermatitis charaterized by erythema and pruritus that may progress to vesiculation and oozing.
If rash, urticaria, edema, or other manifestations of allergy develop during use, the drug should be discontinued.
Dehydration of the epithelium or an escharotic effect may also result from prolonged contact.
On rare occasions, methemoglobinemia has been reported in connection with the use of benzocaine-containing products.
