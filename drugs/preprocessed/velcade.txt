Bortezomib treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory.
However, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported.
Patients with preexisting symptoms (numbness, pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy during treatment with bortezomib.
Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness.
Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require change in the dose and schedule of bortezomib.
Following dose adjustments, improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy has been reported in  of patients with peripheral neuropathy greater than or equal to grade  in the relapsed multiple myeloma study.
Improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy has been reported in  of patients who discontinued due to grade  neuropathy or who had greater than or equal to grade  peripheral neuropathy in the phase  multiple myeloma studies.
