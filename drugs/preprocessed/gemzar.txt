Myelosuppression is the major dose-limiting factor associated with gemcitabine therapy.
Dosage adjustments for hematologic toxicity are frequently necessary.
Less than 1% of patients have had to discontinue therapy for either anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia.
Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was more common in the elderly, especially older women.
The risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura increases as the cumulative dose of gemcitabine approaches 20,000 mg/m2.

01%): Ischemic colitis, anal pruritus
If the patient is not vomiting due to their disease state, nausea can generally be prevented by administration of prochlorperazine or low-dose oral serotonin antagonists and glucocorticoid therapy.
One study of 790 patients found the rate of WHO grade 3 nausea and vomiting at a frequency of 22% in patients under 65 years of age, and 12% in patients 65 years of age or older.
No evidence of increased hepatic toxicity has been reported with longer duration or greater total cumulative dose.
Very common (10% or more): Increased ALT (68%), increased AST (67%), increased alkaline phosphatase (55%), hyperbilirubinemia (13%)Common (1% to 10%): Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Serious hepatotoxicity (including liver failure and death), increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)Postmarketing reports: Hepatic veno-occlusive disease
Renal failure may not be reversible, even upon discontinuation of therapy.
Very common (10% or more): Proteinuria (45%), hematuria (35%), increased BUN (16%)Common (1% to 10%): Increased creatinine (8%)Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Renal failure, hemolytic-uremic syndrome
The flu-like symptoms usually take place a few hours after drug administration.
The symptoms are usually self-limiting and recovery is generally within 24 to 48 hours.
Less than 1% of patients discontinued use due to flu-like symptoms.
Some patients get relief from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or acetaminophen.
Out of the five reported cases of distal ischemic changes, four of those case related to combination chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine (the active ingredient contained in Gemzar)  while one case was of gemcitabine as a single agent in first-line therapy.
Very common (10% or more): Fever (41%), asthenia, chillsCommon (1% to 10%): Paresthesia Rare (less than 0.
1%): Radiation toxicity, radiation recallFrequency not reported: Cough, chills, pattern of tissue injury typically associated with radiation toxicity
Rash was generally a macular or finely granular maculopapular pruritic eruption, mild to moderate in severity, involving the trunk and extremities.
Alopecia is usually minimal.
Very common (10% or more): Allergic skin rash frequently associated with pruritus (30%), alopecia (15%)Common (1% to 10%): Itching, sweatingRare (0.
01% to 0.

01%): Lyell's syndrome (toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson SyndromePostmarketing reports: Cellulitis
Very common (10% or more): Dyspnea (23%)Common (1% to 10%): Cough, rhinitisUncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Interstitial pneumonitis, bronchospasmRare (0.
01% to 0.
1%): Pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)Very rare (less than 0.
01%): Respiratory failure/deathFrequency not reported: Pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary edema
Some of the dyspnea reported may have been due to underlying disease.
Forty percent of the study population consisted of lung cancer patients, while some of the other study patients had pulmonary manifestations of other malignancies.
Different patterns of lung injury may be related to gemcitabine.
A rapid response following the administration of corticosteroids would mean the respiratory problem was probably due to a hypersensitivity reaction.
Common (1% to 10%): Headache, insomnia, somnolence, paraesthesiaUncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Cerebrovascular accidentPostmarketing reports: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
Less than 1% of the paresthesias have been severe.
Very common (10% or more): Injection site reactions (mainly mild)
Rare (less than 0.
1%): Hypersensibility
Many of the patients that suffered cardiovascular effects had a prior history of cardiovascular disease.
Two percent of patients discontinued therapy due to these effects.
Less than 1% of patients discontinued due to edema.
Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Arrhythmias (predominantly supraventricular), heart failureRare (less than 0.
