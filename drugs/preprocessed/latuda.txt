Other side effects include: oculogyric crisis, trismus, agitation, anxiety, dystonia, torticollis, increased serum prolactin, and weight gain.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most commonly reported adverse events included somnolence, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and nausea.
Common ( to ): Increase weight, increased appetite, decreased appetiteFrequency not reported: Increase in blood sugar levels
In uncontrolled, long-term schizophrenia trials, this drug was associated with a mean increase in glucose from baseline of  mg/dL at  weeks,  mg/dL at  weeks, and  mg/dL at  weeks.
Similar results were observed in bipolar depression studies.
The proportion of lurasidone-treated patients with a  or greater increase in body weight was  (compared with  for placebo).
Pooled data from short-term trials showed a mean weight gain of  kg in lurasidone-treated patients (compared with - kg in placebo).
Very common ( or more): Nausea (up to )Common ( to ): Vomiting, dyspepsia, salivary hypersecretion, dry mouth, diarrheaUncommon ( to ): Abdominal pain, diarrheaRare (less than ): GastritisFrequency not reported: Dysphagia
Very common ( or more): Somnolence (up to ), akathisia (up to ), extrapyramidal disorder (up to )Common ( to ): Dizziness, dystoniaUncommon ( to ): Cerebrovascular accident, dysarthria, seizuresFrequency not reported: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, gait disturbance
Akathisia and extrapyramidal symptoms were dose-related.
Very common ( or more): Insomnia Common ( to ): Agitation, anxiety, restlessnessUncommon ( to ): Abnormal dreams, panic attack, sleep disorder, suicidal ideation, activation of mania/hypomania, catatoniaFrequency not reported: Panic attack, sleep disorder
Uncommon ( to ): AnemiaRare (less than ): EosinophiliaFrequency not reported: Leukopenia, neutropenia
Common ( to ): Tachycardia, hypertensionUncommon ( to ): AV block st degree, angina pectoris, bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, hypotensionRare (less than ): SyncopeFrequency not reported: Bradycardia
In short-term trials, orthostatic hypotension and syncope were reported in  and  (n=) of patients in schizophrenia studies.
There were no reports in the bipolar depression monotherapy trials.
ECG measurements taken at various points during clinical trials found no QT prolongations exceeding  milliseconds (ms) including a subset of patients defined as having an increased cardiac risk.
In a dedicated QT study in clinically stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n=), the maximum mean increase in QTc was  ms and  ms for a  mg and  mg dose, respectively.
No patient experienced a QTc increase of greater than  ms from baseline and no patient experienced a QTc greater than  ms.
Common ( to ): Back pain, increased creatinine phosphokinaseUncommon ( to ): Joint stiffness, myalgia, neck painRare (less than ): Rhabdomyolysis
Common ( to ): Rash, pruritusUncommon ( to ): HyperhidrosisRare (less than ): Angioedema
Common ( to ): Urinary tract infectionUncommon ( to ): Dysuria, amenorrhea, dysmenorrheaRare (less than ): Erectile dysfunction
Common ( to ): Elevated serum creatinineRare (less than ): Renal failure
In schizophrenia studies, the proportion of patients with prolactin elevations  times the upper limit of normal ( x ULN) or greater was  compared with  in placebo.
The proportion of female patients and male patients with elevations of  x ULN or greater was  and , respectively.
Common ( to ): Elevated prolactin levelsRare (less than ): Breast enlargement, breast pain, galactorrhea
Uncommon ( to ): Alanine aminotransferase increased
Postmarketing reports: Hypersensitivity
