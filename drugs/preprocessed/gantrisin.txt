In general, although not every side effect listed in the side effects section may have been reported with the use of sulfisoxazole (the active ingredient contained in Gantrisin)  they have all been reported with the use of one or more sulfonamide compounds.

Hypersensitivity side effects have included anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome), toxic epidermal necrolysis, angioedema, arteritis and vasculitis, serum sickness, conjunctival and scleral injection, generalized allergic reactions, and allergic myocarditis.
The use of sulfonamide antibiotics is associated with large increases in the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, although these phenomena are rare as a whole.

Elevated liver-associated enzymes have been reported in patients with hepatitis.
Rare cases of hepatic necrosis have been associated with some sulfonamides.
Renal side effects have included elevated BUN and creatinine, acute renal failure, nephritis, and nephrosis with oliguria and anuria.
The frequency of renal complications is lower with the more soluble sulfonamides, such as sulfisoxazole (the active ingredient contained in Gantrisin) 
Genitourinary side effects have included crystalluria, hematuria, and urinary retention.
Cardiovascular side effects have included tachycardia, palpitations, syncope, cyanosis, angioedema, arteritis, and vasculitis.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included pseudomembranous colitis, nausea, emesis, anorexia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, flatulence, glossitis, stomatitis, enlarged salivary gland, and pancreatitis.
