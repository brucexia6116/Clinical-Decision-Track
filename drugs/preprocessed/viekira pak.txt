Very common (10% or more): Elevated total bilirubin (up to 54%), elevated ALT (up to 25%)Frequency not reported: Drug-related liver injury, jaundice, hyperbilirubinemiaPostmarketing reports: Hepatic decompensation, hepatic failure
Grade 3 (greater than 3 to 10 times the upper limit of normal [3 to 10 x ULN]) and grade 4 (greater than 10 x ULN) total bilirubin elevations have been reported in up to 9.
7% and 0.
1% of patients, respectively.
Grade 3 (greater than 5 to 20 x ULN) and grade 4 (greater than 20 x ULN) ALT elevations have been reported in up to 1.
1% and up to 0.
5% of patients, respectively.
Post-baseline bilirubin elevations (at least 2 x ULN) occurred in 15% of patients using this product with ribavirin compared to 2% of those using this product alone.
These increases were primarily indirect and associated with inhibition of OATP1B1/1B3 (bilirubin transporters) by paritaprevir and ribavirin-induced hemolysis.
Bilirubin elevations occurred after therapy initiation, peaked by week 1 of the study, and usually resolved with ongoing therapy.
Elevated bilirubin was not associated with elevated serum ALT.
Elevations in total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN (mostly indirect) were reported in 34 of 63 HCV/HIV-1 coinfected patients using this product with ribavirin.
At the time of bilirubin elevation, 15 of these patients were also using atazanavir and 9 patients also reported ocular icterus, jaundice, or hyperbilirubinemia.
No concurrent elevations of aminotransferases occurred with hyperbilirubinemia.
About 1% of patients had post-baseline serum ALT levels greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (5 x ULN) during therapy; incidence increased to 25% (4/16) in women concurrently using a product containing ethinyl estradiol.
Clinically relevant ALT elevations were reported in 2 of 59 women using estrogens other than ethinyl estradiol (e.
g.
, estradiol, conjugated estrogens [hormone replacement therapy]).
ALT elevations were usually asymptomatic, occurred during the first 4 weeks of therapy (20 days [mean]; range: 8 to 56 days), and resolved with continued use.
Most ALT elevations were assessed as drug-related liver injury.
Elevated ALT was usually not associated with elevated bilirubin.
Cirrhosis was not a risk factor for elevated ALT.
Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure (including liver transplantation or fatal outcomes) have been reported in patients using ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (with and without dasabuvir and with and without ribavirin).
Most patients with these severe outcomes had evidence of advanced/decompensated cirrhosis before starting therapy.
Cases were generally reported within 1 to 4 weeks of starting therapy and characterized by acute onset of rising direct serum bilirubin levels without increases in ALT together with clinical signs/symptoms of hepatic decompensation.
