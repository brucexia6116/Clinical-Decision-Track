Codeine: Frequency not reported: Respiratory depression Phenylephrine: Frequency not reported: Respiratory distress Promethazine:Frequency not reported: Asthma, nasal stuffiness, respiratory depression, apnea
Concomitant administration of promethazine with other respiratory depressants has been associated with respiratory depression, including fatalities.
Postmarketing cases in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age has been reported with a wide range of weight-based doses.
Respiratory depression has been associated with antitussive use of codeine in young children.
Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine in the postoperative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.
Further investigation has shown these patients to be ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.
Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine appear to be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.
Codeine: Frequency not reported: Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, circulatory depressionPhenylephrine: Frequency not reported: IschemiaPromethazine:Frequency not reported: Increased or decreased blood pressure, tachycardia, bradycardia, faintness
