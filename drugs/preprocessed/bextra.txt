An increase in cardiovascular thromboembolic events (i.

, myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (leg), and pulmonary embolism) have been reported in post CABG patients (n=) treated with valdecoxib (the active ingredient contained in Bextra) compared to placebo.
The risk of the intravenous form is higher  than the oral form  immediately following CABG surgery.
Studies to evaluate valdecoxib's long-term cardiovascular safety profile in patients with arthritis are being planned by the makers of the drug.
Cardiovascular side effects reported in less than  of patients have included aggravated hypertension, aneurysm, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disorder, heart murmur, and hypotension.
A greater frequency of cardiovascular events has been reported in patients given valdecoxib following a coronary artery bypass grafting surgery than in those given standard pain treatment.
Nervous side effects have included headache and dizziness.
Other side effects reported have included cerebrovascular disorder, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, migraine, neuralgia, neuropathy, paresthesia, tremor, twitching, convulsions, and vertigo.
In a recent letter to healthcare professionals sent by the manufacturer of valdecoxib (the active ingredient contained in Bextra)  the following postmarketing dermatologic adverse effects have been reported: erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Data obtained from postmarketing adverse event reporting suggest that the skin reactions have occurred primarily within the first two weeks of valdecoxib therapy.
Toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported in a -year-old woman, with a documented sulfa allergy, after taking valdecoxib for  days.
Dermatologic side effects have included serious, potentially fatal skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
These reactions are most likely to occur in the first two weeks of treatment, but can occur any time during therapy.
In a few cases these reactions have resulted in death.
The reported rate of these serious skin reactions appears to be greater for valdecoxib than other COX- agents.
