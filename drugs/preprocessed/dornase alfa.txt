Commonly reported side effects of dornase alfa include: transient skin rash and voice disorder.
Other side effects include: laryngitis.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Dornase alfa has been generally well tolerated.
Dose ranging studies employing daily dosages as high as  mg revealed no significant adverse effects.
The most common adverse reactions have been respiratory in nature and included pharyngitis ( to  versus  with placebo, n=), voice alteration or hoarseness ( to  versus ), laryngitis ( to  versus ), dyspnea and increase in cough.
Rash has also occurred frequently ( to  versus ).
Many of these adverse reactions have been difficult to distinguish from symptoms of the underlying disease.
Hoarseness and pharyngitis have been shown to be dose-related in one study.
The hoarseness was transient and regressed after a  week period.
Withdrawal rates in clinical trials have been similar between active and placebo groups.
Cardiovascular side effects have included chest pain, which has been reported in  to  of patients receiving dornase alfa versus  with placebo.
Ocular side effects have included conjunctivitis which has been reported in  to  of patients receiving dornase alfa versus  with placebo.
Hypersensitivity side effects have included a small percentage of patients who developed serum antibodies to the drug, but no anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions have been reported.
The clinical relevance of the rhDNase antibodies is presently unknown.
No immunoglobulin E antibodies have been detected.

Special face masks are not needed for caregivers involved with the administration of dornase alfa.
Studies have shown that the passive airborne exposure is well below the clinical dose during administration and nondetectable  to  minutes after treatment.
