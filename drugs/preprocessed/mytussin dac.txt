Check with your doctor if any of these most COMMON side effects persist or become bothersome:
Constipation; dizziness; drowsiness; excitability; headache; nausea; nervousness or anxiety; trouble sleeping; vomiting; weakness.
Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); blurred vision or other vision changes; confusion; difficulty urinating; fainting; fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat; hallucinations; mental or mood changes; persistent trouble sleeping; seizures; severe dizziness, lightheadedness, or headache; severe drowsiness; shallow breathing; tremor; uncontrolled muscle movement.
The more commonly expected adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and dizziness.
Codeine Frequency not reported: CNS depression, lightheadedness, dizziness, sedation, headache, convulsions, weaknessPseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Restlessness, dizziness, weakness, headache, drowsiness, tremor
Codeine Frequency not reported: Tachycardia, bradycardia, palpitation, faintness, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, circulatory depressionPseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Tachycardia, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, impaired circulation to the extremities, coronary artery spasm, chest pain
Hypotension is rare and has been reported most frequently with high doses of codeine.
Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which generally does not produce hypertension, but may be problematic for patients with preexisting hypertension.
Arrhythmias may be produced in predisposed patients.
Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been reported to cause coronary artery spasm and chest pain.
Codeine Frequency not reported: Nausea, vomiting, constipation, biliary tract spasm, increased colonic motility, toxic dilationGuaifenesin: Frequency not reported: Abdominal pain (upper), diarrhea, nausea, vomitingPseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, ischemic colitis
Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis may experience increased colonic motility, while patients with acute ulcerative colitis have experienced toxic dilation with codeine use.
Codeine Frequency not reported: Oliguria, urinary retention, antidiuretic effectPseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Urinary retention
Codeine Frequency not reported: Pruritus, giant urticaria, angioneurotic edema, laryngeal edemaGuaifenesin: Frequency not reported: Hypersensitivity reactions (pruritus, urticaria) Pseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Fixed drug eruptions
Codeine: Frequency not reported: RashGuaifenesin: Frequency not reported: Rash Pseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Fixed drug eruption in the form of erythematous nodular patches, rash
Codeine Frequency not reported: Visual disturbancesPseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Angle-closure glaucoma
Codeine Frequency not reported: Euphoria, dysphoria, transient hallucination, disorientationPseudoephedrine: Frequency not reported: Hallucinations (particularly in children), anxiety, excitability, insomnia
Respiratory depression has been associated with antitussive use of codeine in young children.
Respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received codeine in the postoperative period following tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy.
Further investigation has shown these patients to be ultra-rapid metabolizers of codeine.
Children with obstructive sleep apnea who are treated with codeine appear to be particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant effects of codeine.
Codeine: Frequency not reported: Respiratory depression
