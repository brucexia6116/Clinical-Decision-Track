Along with their needed effects, medicines like lomustine (the active ingredient contained in CeeNU) can sometimes cause unwanted effects such as blood problems, loss of hair, and other side effects; these are described below.
Also, because of the way these medicines act on the body, there is a chance that they might cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.
These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer, such as leukemia.
Discuss these possible effects with your doctor.
