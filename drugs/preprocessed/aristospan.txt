If any of the following side effects occur while taking triamcinolone, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
Cardiovascular side effects have included fluid retention, sodium retention, congestive heart failure, potassium loss, hypokalemic alkalosis, and hypertension.
Musculoskeletal side effects have included aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, calcinosis (following intra-articular or intra-lesional use), Charcot-like arthropathy, loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, pathologic fracture of long bones, postinjection flare (following intra-articular use), steroid myopathy, tendon rupture, and vertebral compression fractures.
Postmarketing experience has included very rare reports of bone mineral density loss and osteoporosis, especially with prolonged use, which may lead to an increased risk of fractures.
Decreases in bone density of the total hip and the trochanter have been reported with the use of inhaled triamcinolone acetonide in a study (n=) of premenopausal women with asthma.
The yearly change in bone density at the total hip and the trochanter showed a greater decline as the number of puffs per day of the inhaled glucocorticoid increased.

Ocular side effects have included posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and exophthalmos.
Retinal and choroidal occlusion as a complication after posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone (the active ingredient contained in Aristospan) injection has been reported.
Metabolic side effects have included negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism.
Hypersensitivity side effects have included anaphylactoid reactions, anaphylaxis, and angioedema.
