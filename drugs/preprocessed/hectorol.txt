Side effects include:

In predialysis patients with stage  or  CKD: infection,  chest pain,  constipation,  dyspepsia,  anemia,  dehydration,  depression,  hypertonia,  insomnia,  paresthesia,  increased cough,  dyspnea,  rhinitis.
Excessive vitamin D intake (early manifestations): weakness,   headache,   somnolence,   nausea,  vomiting,  dry mouth,   constipation,   bone pain,   metallic taste,   anorexia.

Excessive vitamin D intake (late manifestations): polyuria,   polydipsia   anorexia,   weight loss,   nocturia,   calcific conjunctivitis,   pancreatitis,   photophobia,   rhinorrhea,   pruritus,   hyperthermia,   decreased libido,   increased BUN,   albuminuria,   hypercholesterolemia,   increased serum AST and ALT concentrations,   ectopic calcification,   hypertension,   cardiac arrhythmias,   sensory disturbances,   dehydration,   apathy,   growth arrest,   urinary tract infections.

Early signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia have included weakness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, muscle pain, bone pain, metallic taste, and anorexia.
Prolonged hypercalcemia may result in polyuria, polydipsia, anorexia, weight loss, nocturia conjunctivitis (calcific), pancreatitis, photophobia, rhinorrhea, pruritus, hyperthermia, decreased libido, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), albuminuria, hypercholesterolemia, elevated serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), ectopic calcification, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, sensory disturbances, dehydration, apathy, arrested growth, urinary tract infections, and, rarely, overt psychosis.
Hyperphosphatemia may exacerbate hyperparathyroidism.
Hypercalciuria may accelerate the onset of renal failure.
