If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking diclofenac / misoprostol, get emergency help immediately:
The highest reported incidences of adverse events for this drug were gastrointestinal and included abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, and flatulence.
NSAIDs including this drug, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) events which can occur at any time, with or without warning.
For patients who develop a serious upper GI event, only about  were symptomatic.
Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation occurred in approximately  of patients treated with NSAIDs for  to  months and  to  of patients treated for  year.
Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding had a greater than -fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors.
Diclofenac-misoprostol: Very common ( or more): Abdominal pain , diarrhea , dyspepsia , nausea Common ( to ): Flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, eructation, constipation, peptic ulcerUncommon ( to ): StomatitisRare (less than ): Esophageal ulceration, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux, heartburn, hematemesis, melena, gall bladder disorderFrequency not reported: PancreatitisPostmarketing reports: Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, GI bleeding, melena, colitis, Crohn's disease, esophageal disorder, mouth ulceration, tongue edema, dry mouthDiclofenac:Very common ( or more): Abdominal pain , diarrhea , dyspepsia , nausea Common ( to ): Flatulence, nausea
Uncommon ( to ): Hypertension, chest pain, edema, palpitation, syncopeRare (less than ): Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, myocardial infarction, premature ventricular contractions, tachycardia, vasculitis, phlebitisFrequency not reported: Cardiac failure, palpitations
Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase (COX)- selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to  years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.
All NSAIDs appear to have a similar risk.
There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates this increased risk and may be associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal events.
Common ( to ): Alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increasedRare (less than ): Hepatitis, jaundice, abnormal hepatic functionFrequency not reported: Liver failurePostmarketing reports: Hepatitis fulminant, blood bilirubin increased
Elevations to greater than  x ULN of ALT occurred in about  (n=) of patients receiving diclofenac-misoprostol at some point during treatment.
These increases were generally transient and returned to within normal range upon discontinuation of therapy.
In an open-labeled trial among patients receiving NSAIDs, a higher incidence of transaminase elevations were observed in patients receiving diclofenac compared with other NSAIDs.
Rare (less than ): Allergic reactionsFrequency not reported: Angioedema, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema, urticariaPostmarketing reports: Anaphylaxis
Common ( to ): Erythema multiforme, rash, pruritusUncommon ( to ): Purpura, urticariaRare (less than ): Angioedema, increased sweating, acnePostmarketing reports: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, dermatitis exfoliative, dermatitis bullous, Henoch Schonlein purpura, mucocutaneous rash, rash vesicular, photosensitivity reaction, alopecia
Frequency not reported: Renal failure, glomerulonephritis membranous, glomerulonephritis minimal lesionPostmarketing reports: Acute renal failure, renal papillary necrosis, nephritis, interstitial nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria
Uncommon ( to ): Thrombocytopenia Rare (less than ): Agranulocytosis, anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation time increased, ecchymosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, decreased hematocrit
NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients.
Unlike aspirin, the NSAID effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.
Rare (less than ): Anorexia, appetite changes, dehydration, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, weight changes, gout, hypercholesterolemia, porphyria
Common ( to ): Headache, dizzinessRare (less than ): Drowsiness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypertonia, hypoesthesia, insomnia, meningitis, migraine, neuralgia, paresthesia, somnolence, stroke, tremor, confusionFrequency not reported: Coma Postmarketing reports: Convulsions, memory disturbance, taste disturbance

Rare (less than ): Asthenia, fatigue, fever, malaise, chills, hearing impairment, tinnitus, speech disorder
Diclofenac-misoprostol: Rare (less than ): Vaginitis, menstrual disorder, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, intermenstrual bleeding, cystitis, dysuria, nocturia Frequency not reported: Impotence, perineal pain Postmarketing reports: Intrauterine death, uterine rupture, incomplete abortion, abnormal uterine contractions, retained placenta, dysuria, urine abnormalMisoprostol: Frequency not reported: Hyperstimulation of the uterus, amniotic fluid embolism resulting in maternal and fetal death, severe vaginal bleeding, retained placenta, pelvic pain, uterine rupture
Misoprostol may cause abortion.
It has been used outside of its approved indications to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, however a major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus.
Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, and severe genital bleeding have been reported.
