If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking diclofenac / misoprostol, get emergency help immediately:
The highest reported incidences of adverse events for this drug were gastrointestinal and included abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, and flatulence.
NSAIDs including this drug, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) events which can occur at any time, with or without warning.
For patients who develop a serious upper GI event, only about 20% were symptomatic.
Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation occurred in approximately 1% of patients treated with NSAIDs for 3 to 6 months and 2% to 4% of patients treated for 1 year.
Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding had a greater than 10-fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors.
Diclofenac-misoprostol: Very common (10% or more): Abdominal pain (21%), diarrhea (19%), dyspepsia (14%), nausea (11%)Common (1% to 10%): Flatulence, gastritis, vomiting, eructation, constipation, peptic ulcerUncommon (0.
1% to 1%): StomatitisRare (less than 0.
1%): Esophageal ulceration, esophagitis, gastroesophageal reflux, heartburn, hematemesis, melena, gall bladder disorderFrequency not reported: PancreatitisPostmarketing reports: Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation, GI bleeding, melena, colitis, Crohn's disease, esophageal disorder, mouth ulceration, tongue edema, dry mouthDiclofenac:Very common (10% or more): Abdominal pain (15%), diarrhea (11%), dyspepsia (11%), nausea (11%)Common (1% to 10%): Flatulence, nausea
Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Hypertension, chest pain, edema, palpitation, syncopeRare (less than 0.
1%): Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, myocardial infarction, premature ventricular contractions, tachycardia, vasculitis, phlebitisFrequency not reported: Cardiac failure, palpitations
Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to 3 years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.
All NSAIDs appear to have a similar risk.
There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates this increased risk and may be associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal events.
Common (1% to 10%): Alanine aminotransferase increased, aspartate aminotransferase increasedRare (less than 0.
1%): Hepatitis, jaundice, abnormal hepatic functionFrequency not reported: Liver failurePostmarketing reports: Hepatitis fulminant, blood bilirubin increased
Elevations to greater than 3 x ULN of ALT occurred in about 1.
6% (n=2184) of patients receiving diclofenac-misoprostol at some point during treatment.
These increases were generally transient and returned to within normal range upon discontinuation of therapy.
In an open-labeled trial among patients receiving NSAIDs, a higher incidence of transaminase elevations were observed in patients receiving diclofenac compared with other NSAIDs.
Rare (less than 0.
1%): Allergic reactionsFrequency not reported: Angioedema, laryngeal/pharyngeal edema, urticariaPostmarketing reports: Anaphylaxis
Common (1% to 10%): Erythema multiforme, rash, pruritusUncommon (0.

1%): Agranulocytosis, anemia, aplastic anemia, coagulation time increased, ecchymosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, decreased hematocrit
NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients.
Unlike aspirin, the NSAID effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.
Rare (less than 0.

Misoprostol may cause abortion.
It has been used outside of its approved indications to ripen the cervix, to induce labor, and to treat postpartum hemorrhage, however a major adverse effect of these uses is hyperstimulation of the uterus.
Uterine rupture, amniotic fluid embolism, and severe genital bleeding have been reported.
