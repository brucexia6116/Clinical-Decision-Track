Commonly reported side effects of riluzole include: asthenia, nausea, and increased serum alanine aminotransferase.
Other side effects include: vomiting.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, riluzole may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some riluzole side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
At least one elevation in ALT has occurred in  of patients receiving riluzole.
An ALT greater than  times the upper limit of normal has occurred in approximately  of patients.
These elevations tend to occur within the first  months of treatment, are usually transient if less than  times the upper limit of normal, and may return to normal within  to  months if therapy is continued.
There is little experience in the management of patients whose ALT exceeds  times the upper limit of normal.
The manufacturer recommends discontinuing the drug if ALT exceeds  times the upper limit of normal or if jaundice occurs.
In one patient receiving riluzole for epilepsy and concurrently taking phenobarbital and carbamazepine, clinical jaundice developed four months after starting riluzole (ALT  X ULN, AST  X ULN, and bilirubin  X ULN).
Liver function tests returned to normal  weeks after discontinuing riluzole therapy.
Hepatic side effects including elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and jaundice have been reported.
Cases of clinical hepatitis associated with riluzole have been reported, including one with a fatal outcome.
Most gastrointestinal side effects have been dose-related.
Nausea and abdominal pain commonly resulted in discontinuation of riluzole during clinical trials.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea , abdominal pain , vomiting , anorexia , and diarrhea .
Two cases of pancreatitis have also been reported.
Musculoskeletal side effects including asthenia (which appears to be dose-related)  and muscle stiffness have been reported.
Respiratory side effects including cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported in patients treated with riluzole, some of them severe.
Upon further investigation, many of these cases were hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Nervous system side effects appear to be dose-related.
Dizziness occurred more frequently in female patients.
Nervous system side effects including dizziness , vertigo , circumoral paresthesias  and somnolence  have been reported.
Hematologic side effects including anemia and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than /mm) have rarely been reported.
A case of methemoglobinemia has also been reported.
Cardiovascular side effects including mild to moderate increases in blood pressure have been reported.
Hypersensitivity side effects including anaphylaxis have been reported.
It is possible that some side effects of riluzole may not have been reported.
These can be reported to the FDA here.
