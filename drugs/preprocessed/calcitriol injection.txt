See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Side effects include:
Excessive vitamin D intake (early manifestations): weakness,   headache,    somnolence,   nausea,   dry mouth,   constipation,   muscle or bone pain,   metallic taste.

Excessive vitamin D intake (late manifestations): polyuria,   polydipsia,   anorexia,   weight loss,   nocturia,   calcific conjunctivitis,   pancreatitis,   photophobia,   rhinorrhea,   pruritus,   hyperthermia,   decreased libido,   elevated BUN,   albuminuria,   hypercholesterolemia,   elevated AST,   elevated ALT,   ectopic calcification,   nephrocalcinosis,   hypertension,   cardiac arrhythmias,   dystrophy,   sensory disturbances,   dehydration,   apathy,   arrested growth, urinary tract infections.

Early signs of excessive vitamin D intake include weakness, headache, somnolence, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, constipation, muscle pain, bone pain, metallic taste, anorexia, abdominal pain, or stomach ache.
Late signs include polyuria, polydipsia, anorexia, weight loss, nocturia, conjunctivitis (calcific), pancreatitis, photophobia, rhinorrhea, pruritus, hyperthermia, decreased libido, elevated BUN, albuminuria, hypercholesterolemia, elevated AST and ALT, ectopic calcification, nephrocalcinosis, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, dystrophy, sensory disturbances, dehydration, apathy, arrested growth, urinary tract infections, and rarely, overt psychosis.
Adverse events were similar to those of excessive vitamin D intake, hypercalcemia syndrome or calcium intoxication.
