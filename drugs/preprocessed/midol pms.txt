Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction:  hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
In rare cases, acetaminophen may cause a severe skin reaction that can be fatal.
This could occur even if you have taken acetaminophen in the past and had no reaction.
Stop taking this medicine and call your doctor right away if you have skin redness or a rash that spreads and causes blistering and peeling.
If you have this type of reaction, you should never again take any medicine that contains acetaminophen.
Stop using this medicine and call your doctor at once if you have:
any redness or swelling; 
little or no urination; or
liver problems--nausea, upper stomach pain, itching, loss of appetite, dark urine, clay-colored stools, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes).
Common side effects may include:
dizziness, drowsiness;
dry mouth, nose, or throat;
constipation;
blurred vision; or
feeling restless or excited (especially in children).
This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.
