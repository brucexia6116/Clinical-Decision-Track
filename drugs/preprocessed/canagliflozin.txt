Commonly reported side effects of canagliflozin include: vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginitis, and mean glomerular filtration rate decreased.
Other side effects include: balanitis, balanoposthitis, increased urine output, nocturia, polyuria, urinary urgency, and pollakiuria.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, vulvovaginal candidiasis, urinary tract infection, and increased urinary frequency.
Very common ( or more): Female genital mycotic infections including vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginitis, vaginal infection, vulvitis, and genital infection fungal (up to ), recurrent male genital mycotic infections Common ( to ): Urinary tract infection, increased urination, male genital mycotic infections including balanitis, balanoposthitis, balanitis candida, and fungal genital infection Uncommon ( to ): PhimosisPostmarketing reports: Urosepsis, pyelonephritis
Common ( to ): Adverse reactions related to reduced intravascular volume (postural hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension, dehydration, and syncope)
Twenty reports of acidosis have been identified in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database during the period March  through  June   All patients required emergency room treatment or hospitalization.
These cases were not typical of ketoacidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in that they occurred in patients with type  diabetes and their blood sugar levels were only slightly increased.
Some factors identified as potentially triggering the acidosis included major illness, reduced food and fluid intake, and reduced insulin dose.
Very common ( or more): Hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue (up to ), hyperkalemia (up to )Common ( to ): Increased serum magnesium, increased serum phosphate, increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C)Postmarketing reports: Acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis, or ketosis
Common ( to ): Constipation, thirst, nausea, abdominal pain, pancreatitis
In a pooled analysis of  clinical trials with a mean duration drug exposure of  weeks, the incidence rate of adjudicated bone fractures were , ,  per  patient years of exposure to the comparator,  or  mg dose, respectively.
Fractures were observed as early as  weeks and were more likely to be caused by low trauma and affect upper extremities.
On September , , the US Food and Drug Administration issued a drug safety communication regarding new information on bone fracture risk and decreased bone mineral density with use of canagliflozin.
Based on updated data, fractures have occurred as early as  weeks after starting therapy with trauma that is usually minor, such as falling from standing height.
Additionally, a -year study (n=) has shown a greater loss of bone mineral density at the hip and lower spine in canagliflozin treated patients compared with placebo.
Uncommon ( to ): Bone fracture, upper extremity fractureFrequency not reported: Loss of bone mineral density at hip and lower spine
Common ( to ): Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedemaFrequency not reported: Serious hypersensitivity reactionPostmarketing reports: Anaphylaxis
Frequency not reported: Increases in serum creatinine, decreases in eGFR, renal impairment, acute renal failurePostmarketing reports: Acute kidney injury
In a pooled analysis among patients with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of renal related adverse reactions such as increased serum creatinine, decreased eGFR, renal impairment, or acute renal failure, was  and  in patients receiving canagliflozin  mg or  mg, compared with  in those receiving comparator drug or placebo.
From March  to October , the US FDA received  confirmable case reports of acute kidney injury (AKI) with use of canagliflozin (n=) or dapagliflozin (n=).
Hospitalization was necessary for evaluation and management in  cases; admission to the intensive care unit occurred in  cases, and death occurred in  patients, of which  were cardiac-related.
Dialysis was necessary in  patients,  of whom had a history of chronic kidney disease or previous AKI.
In  cases, time to onset of AKI was within  month or less of initiating therapy.
In  cases in which drug discontinuation was reported,  reported subsequent improvement;  patients recovered with sequelae,  patients did not recover (including the  deaths mentioned earlier).
Median age was  years (range  to  years; based on  cases reporting age).
Concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy was reported in  cases, diuretic use in  cases, and NSAID use in  cases.
Almost half the patients reported a change in renal function at time of diagnosis (median elevation of serum creatinine from baseline  mg/dL [based on  cases reporting serum creatinine] and median decrease in eGFR  mL/min/m [based on  cases reporting eGFR]).
Uncommon ( to ): Photosensitivity reactions, rash, urticaria
The US FDA has issued a safety alert warning of increased leg and foot amputations (mostly toes) compared to placebo in the ongoing CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) clinical trial.
Interim safety results have shown risk of amputation for patients receiving  mg daily,  mg daily, and placebo were , , and  out of  patients treated, respectively based on an average follow-up of  years.
A similar trial (CANVAS-R) trial has not shown these risks (average follow-up  months).
The FDA will continue to evaluate this safety issue and update as necessary.
