Commonly reported side effects of canagliflozin include: vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginitis, and mean glomerular filtration rate decreased.
Other side effects include: balanitis, balanoposthitis, increased urine output, nocturia, polyuria, urinary urgency, and pollakiuria.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue, vulvovaginal candidiasis, urinary tract infection, and increased urinary frequency.
Very common (10% or more): Female genital mycotic infections including vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginitis, vaginal infection, vulvitis, and genital infection fungal (up to 11.
4%), recurrent male genital mycotic infections (22%)Common (1% to 10%): Urinary tract infection, increased urination, male genital mycotic infections including balanitis, balanoposthitis, balanitis candida, and fungal genital infection Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): PhimosisPostmarketing reports: Urosepsis, pyelonephritis
Common (1% to 10%): Adverse reactions related to reduced intravascular volume (postural hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, hypotension, dehydration, and syncope)
Twenty reports of acidosis have been identified in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database during the period March 2013 through 06 June 2014.
All patients required emergency room treatment or hospitalization.
These cases were not typical of ketoacidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in that they occurred in patients with type 2 diabetes and their blood sugar levels were only slightly increased.
Some factors identified as potentially triggering the acidosis included major illness, reduced food and fluid intake, and reduced insulin dose.
Very common (10% or more): Hypoglycemia when combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue (up to 49%), hyperkalemia (up to 27%)Common (1% to 10%): Increased serum magnesium, increased serum phosphate, increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C)Postmarketing reports: Acidosis including diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis, or ketosis
Common (1% to 10%): Constipation, thirst, nausea, abdominal pain, pancreatitis
In a pooled analysis of 9 clinical trials with a mean duration drug exposure of 85 weeks, the incidence rate of adjudicated bone fractures were 1.
1, 1.
4, 1.
5 per 100 patient years of exposure to the comparator, 100 or 300 mg dose, respectively.
Fractures were observed as early as 12 weeks and were more likely to be caused by low trauma and affect upper extremities.
On September 10, 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a drug safety communication regarding new information on bone fracture risk and decreased bone mineral density with use of canagliflozin.
Based on updated data, fractures have occurred as early as 12 weeks after starting therapy with trauma that is usually minor, such as falling from standing height.
Additionally, a 2-year study (n=714) has shown a greater loss of bone mineral density at the hip and lower spine in canagliflozin treated patients compared with placebo.
Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Bone fracture, upper extremity fractureFrequency not reported: Loss of bone mineral density at hip and lower spine
Common (1% to 10%): Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedemaFrequency not reported: Serious hypersensitivity reactionPostmarketing reports: Anaphylaxis
Frequency not reported: Increases in serum creatinine, decreases in eGFR, renal impairment, acute renal failurePostmarketing reports: Acute kidney injury
In a pooled analysis among patients with moderate renal impairment, the incidence of renal related adverse reactions such as increased serum creatinine, decreased eGFR, renal impairment, or acute renal failure, was 8.
9% and 9.
3% in patients receiving canagliflozin 100 mg or 300 mg, compared with 3.
7% in those receiving comparator drug or placebo.
From March 2013 to October 2015, the US FDA received 101 confirmable case reports of acute kidney injury (AKI) with use of canagliflozin (n=73) or dapagliflozin (n=28).
Hospitalization was necessary for evaluation and management in 96 cases; admission to the intensive care unit occurred in 22 cases, and death occurred in 4 patients, of which 2 were cardiac-related.
Dialysis was necessary in 15 patients, 3 of whom had a history of chronic kidney disease or previous AKI.
In 58 cases, time to onset of AKI was within 1 month or less of initiating therapy.
In 78 cases in which drug discontinuation was reported, 56 reported subsequent improvement; 3 patients recovered with sequelae, 11 patients did not recover (including the 4 deaths mentioned earlier).
Median age was 57 years (range 28 to 78 years; based on 84 cases reporting age).
Concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy was reported in 51 cases, diuretic use in 26 cases, and NSAID use in 6 cases.
Almost half the patients reported a change in renal function at time of diagnosis (median elevation of serum creatinine from baseline 1.
6 mg/dL [based on 32 cases reporting serum creatinine] and median decrease in eGFR 46 mL/min/1.
73m2 [based on 13 cases reporting eGFR]).
Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Photosensitivity reactions, rash, urticaria
The US FDA has issued a safety alert warning of increased leg and foot amputations (mostly toes) compared to placebo in the ongoing CANVAS (Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study) clinical trial.
Interim safety results have shown risk of amputation for patients receiving 100 mg daily, 300 mg daily, and placebo were 7, 5, and 3 out of 1000 patients treated, respectively based on an average follow-up of 4.
5 years.
A similar trial (CANVAS-R) trial has not shown these risks (average follow-up 9 months).
The FDA will continue to evaluate this safety issue and update as necessary.
