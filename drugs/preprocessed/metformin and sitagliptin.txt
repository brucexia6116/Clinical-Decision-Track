Commonly reported side effects of metformin/sitagliptin include: lactic acidosis.
Other side effects include: nausea.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Metformin-sitagliptin:Very common ( or more): Hypoglycemia ( when combined with sulfonylurea;  when combined with insulin)Common ( to ): Hypoglycemia, decrease levels of vitamin B without clinical manifestations and rarely associated with anemiaRare (less than ): Lactic acidosis due to metforminSitagliptin:Uncommon ( to ): HypoglycemiaMetformin:Common ( to ): Hypoglycemia ( or more when combined with glyburide)Uncommon ( to ): HypoglycemiaVery rare (less than ): Lactic acidosis, vitamin B deficiency
In metformin-treated patients, the incidence of lactic acidosis has been about  cases per , patient years.
The risk of lactic acidosis has been particularly high in patients with underlying renal insufficiency and rarely in patients with normal renal function.
Concomitant cardiovascular or liver disease, sepsis, and hypoxia have also increased the risk of lactic acidosis.
Signs and symptoms of severe acidosis may include vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, dyspnea, hypothermia, hypotension, and bradycardia.
Long-term treatment with metformin has been associated with a decrease in vitamin B absorption.
Malabsorption of vitamin B, due to intrinsic factor deficiency and possibly other mechanisms, in as many as  of treated patients, were reported.
Megaloblastic anemia has occurred.
Decreased levels of vitamin B appear to be reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B supplementation.
Common ( to ): Diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting Uncommon ( to ): Constipation, upper abdominal pain, dry mouthPostmarketing reports: Indigestion, abdominal discomfort, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis (including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis)Metformin: Very common ( or more): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite Sitagliptin:Rare (less than ): Pancreatitis
Metformin-sitagliptin:Common ( to ): HeadacheUncommon ( to ): SomnolenceFrequency not reported: AstheniaMetformin:Common ( to ): metallic taste
Common ( to ): Upper respiratory tract infections, nasopharyngitis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, bronchitis, sinusitis, influenzaPostmarketing reports: Interstitial lung disease
Frequency not reported: Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis
Metformin-sitagliptin:Postmarketing reports: Hepatic enzyme elevationMetformin:Very rare (less than ): Liver function disorders, hepatitis
Frequency not reported: Impaired renal function, acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis)
Between October  and December , thirty-three cases of severe arthralgia have been reported to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Database.
Each case involved the use of  or more dipeptidyl peptidase- (DPP-) inhibitor.
In all cases, substantial reduction in prior activity level was reported,  patients were hospitalized due to disabling joint pain.
In  cases, symptoms appeared within  month of starting therapy, in  cases symptoms resolved less than  month after discontinuation.
A positive rechallenge was reported in  cases, with  cases involving use of a different DPP- inhibitor.
Sitagliptin had the greatest number of cases reported (n=) followed by saxagliptin (n=), linagliptin (n=), alogliptin (n=), and vildagliptin (n=).
Common ( to ): ArthralgiaPostmarketing reports: Myalgia, pain in extremities, back pain
Common ( to ): Peripheral edema
Postmarketing reports: Angioedema, rash, urticaria, pruritus, cutaneous vasculitis, exfoliative skin conditions including Steven-Johnson syndromeMetformin:Very rare (less than ): Urticaria, erythema, pruritus
Rare (less than ): Megaloblastic anemia
Decreased serum vitamin B levels, without clinical manifestations (rarely megaloblastic anemia), has been reported in approximately  of patients.
The reduction in vitamin B levels may be due to interference with B absorption from the B-intrinsic factor complex and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B supplementation.
