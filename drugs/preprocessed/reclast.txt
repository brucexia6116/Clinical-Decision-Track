Common side effects of Reclast include: hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.
Other side effects include: hypocalcemia.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, zoledronic acid (the active ingredient contained in Reclast) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking zoledronic acid, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
Some zoledronic acid side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
In general, side effects have been mild and transient and similar to other bisphosphonates.
Acute phase reactions have occurred within three days after administration of this drug with symptoms of pyrexia, fatigue, bone pain and/or arthralgias, myalgias, chills, and influenza-like illness.
Symptoms usually resolve within three days of onset, but resolution can take up to  to  days, and some symptoms have persisted for a longer duration.
In the postmenopausal osteoporosis trial, adjudicated serious adverse events of atrial fibrillation in the zoledronic acid (the active ingredient contained in Reclast) treatment group occurred in  of patients ( out of ) compared to  ( out of ) in the placebo group.
The overall incidence of all atrial fibrillation adverse events in the zoledronic acid treatment group was, reported in  of patients ( out of ) in the Reclast group vs.
of patients ( out of ) in the placebo group.

Cases of osteonecrosis (primarily of the jaws) have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients taking this drug.
Many of these patients had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental surgeries.
Osteonecrosis of the jaws has multiple documented risk factors including a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (  chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids) and co-morbid conditions (  anemia, coagulopathies, infection, pre-existing oral disease).

Fever is the most common adverse effect associated with zoledronic acid infusion.
Flu-like syndromes including fever, chills, bone pain, and/or arthralgias and myalgias have also occasionally been reported.
These symptoms generally did not require treatment and resolved within  to  hours.
Very common ( or more): Insomnia , anxiety , depression , agitation Common ( to ): Confusion
The following factors have been associated with an increased risk: Pre-existing renal dysfunction, dehydration, multiple cycles of zoledronic acid (the active ingredient contained in Reclast) or other bisphosphonates, concomitant use of nephrotoxic medicines and use of a shorter infusion time than what is recommended.
The frequency of renal impairment adverse events suspected to be related to this drug was as follows: Multiple myeloma , prostate cancer , breast cancer , lung and other solid tumors .
