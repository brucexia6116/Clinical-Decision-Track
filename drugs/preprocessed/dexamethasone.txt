The most commonly occurring side effects have included alteration in glucose tolerance, behavioral and mood changes, increased appetite, and weight gain; the incidence generally correlates with dosage, timing of administration, and duration of treatment.
A wide range of psychiatric reactions including affective disorders (e.
g.
, irritable, euphoric, depressed, labile mood, and suicidal ideation) psychotic reactions (e.
g.
, mania, delusions, hallucinations, aggravation of schizophrenia), behavioral disturbances, irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances and cognitive dysfunction (e.
g.
, confusion, amnesia) have been reported.
These reactions have been reported in adults and children.
In adults, the occurrence of severe reactions has been estimated to be about 5% to 6%.
