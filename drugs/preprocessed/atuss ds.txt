Some of these cases were only partially relieved by discontinuation of the drug.
Haloperidol was successful in relieving symptoms.
Nervous system side effects of chlorpheniramine have included drowsiness in 75% or more of treated patients.
Dyskinesias have rarely been reported following chronic use of chlorpheniramine.
Nervous system side effects of dextromethorphan have included drowsiness and dizziness.
Other side effects such as excitation, mental confusion, and opioid like respiratory depression have been rare and occurred at higher dosages.
In some cases of abuse, patients experienced euphoria, hyperactivity, mania, and auditory and visual hallucinations.
Nervous system side effects of pseudoephedrine have included insomnia in up to 30% of patients.
Tremor, anxiety, nervousness, and headache have also been reported.
Gastrointestinal side effects of chlorpheniramine have included dry mouth and constipation in up to one-third of treated patients.

Gastrointestinal side effects of pseudoephedrine have included anorexia and gastric irritation in approximately 5% of patients.

Pseudoephedrine causes vasoconstriction which generally does not produce hypertension, but may be problematic for patients with preexisting hypertension.
Arrhythmias may be produced in predisposed patients.
Rarely, pseudoephedrine has been reported to cause coronary artery spasm and chest pain.
One report evaluated the effect with 60 mg of pseudoephedrine on individuals in a hyperbaric chamber at 1 atmosphere (simulated scuba dive to 66 feet of sea water).
Pseudoephedrine and depth (simulated) were found to have significant but opposite effects on heart rate, although these effects were unlikely to be clinically significant during diving.
Cardiovascular side effects of chlorpheniramine have included hypotension, tachycardia, and palpitations.
Cardiovascular side effects of pseudoephedrine have included tachycardia.

A fatal case of agranulocytosis has been reported in a patient taking chlorpheniramine, pseudoephedrine, acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, phenylpropanolamine, and aspirin.
