If any of the following side effects occur while taking folic acid, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported rarely.
They have included anorexia, nausea, abdominal distention, flatulence, and bitter taste.
Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported among patients with doses of  mg/day.
Nervous system side effects have included sleep disturbances, concentration problems, irritability, anxiety, depression, confusion, and impaired judgment.
Parenteral administration of high doses of folic acid have been associated with increased seizure activity in patients with epilepsy.
Nervous system side effects have been reported in some patients who were taking  mg/day.
Daily doses of folic acid >  mcg/day can obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurologic signs and symptoms progress.
Hypersensitivity side effects have been reported rarely.
They have included erythema, rash, pruritus, malaise, dyspnea with bronchospasm, and a single case of apparent anaphylaxis.
Metabolic side effects have included impaired gastrointestinal absorption of zinc.
A measurable decline in plasma zinc has been associated with folic acid dosages as low as  mcg/day.
Zinc is an intrinsic part of at least  metalloenzymes and other cellular components, and is essential for the synthesis of protein, DNA, and RNA.
While zinc deficiency is rare, it may become a problem during pregnancy or with patients who have inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption, liver cirrhosis, and high alcohol intake.
Zinc deficiency usually presents as diarrhea; mental irritability; depression; skin lesions of the face, perineum, limbs, and skin folds; alopecia; loss of taste; and defects in the immunologic system.
