Pancreatitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients receiving this drug, including those who developed hypertriglyceridemia.
Although a causal relationship has not been established, marked triglyceride elevation is a risk factor for the development of pancreatitis.

Increased total cholesterol (greater than  mg/dL), triglycerides (greater than  mg/dL), glucose (greater than  mg/dL), and uric acid (greater than  mg/dL) have been reported in up to , up to , up to , and up to  of patients, respectively.
Decreased inorganic phosphorus (less than  mg/dL) has been reported in up to  of patients.
Episodes of hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus have been reported during postmarketing studies in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors.
In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred.
No causal relationship has been established.
Very common ( or more): Increased GGT (up to ), increased ALT (up to )Common ( to ): Increased AST, hepatitis (including increased AST, ALT, GGT), increased total bilirubinUncommon ( to ): Hepatomegaly, cholangitis, hepatic steatosis, hyperbilirubinemiaFrequency not reported: Fatty liver deposit, cytolytic hepatitis, liver tenderness, hepatic failure, cholecystitis, hepatic dysfunctionPostmarketing reports: Jaundice
Increased GGT (greater than  units/L), ALT (greater than  units/L), AST (greater than  units/L), and total bilirubin (greater than  mg/dL) have been reported in up to , up to , up to , and  of patients, respectively.
Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases before initiation of therapy may be at an increased risk for developing further transaminase elevations or liver decompensation.
There have been reports of hepatic dysfunction with some cases leading to death.
A causal relationship with this drug has not been proven since these cases have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV who also had underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and were taking multiple concomitant medications.
