Common side effects of Kaletra include: increased serum cholesterol and increased serum triglycerides.
Other side effects include: hyperglycemia and increased serum amylase.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
In clinical studies, this drug was used with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors with or without efavirenz or nevirapine.
The most common side effects were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia.
Diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting occurred more often at the start of therapy while hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia generally occurred later.
Diarrhea was reported more often when this drug was used once a day than when it was used twice a day.

5%), nausea (up to 10.
3%)Common (1% to 10%): Increased amylase, vomiting, abdominal pain (upper and lower), increased lipase, gastroenteritis and colitis, dyspepsia, pancreatitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hemorrhoids, flatulence, abdominal distention, constipationUncommon (0.

Pancreatitis, including fatalities, has occurred in patients receiving this drug, including those who developed hypertriglyceridemia.
Although a causal relationship has not been established, marked triglyceride elevation is a risk factor for the development of pancreatitis.

Increased total cholesterol (greater than 300 mg/dL), triglycerides (greater than 750 mg/dL), glucose (greater than 250 mg/dL), and uric acid (greater than 12 mg/dL) have been reported in up to 39%, up to 36%, up to 5%, and up to 5% of patients, respectively.
Decreased inorganic phosphorus (less than 1.
5 mg/dL) has been reported in up to 2% of patients.
Episodes of hyperglycemia, new onset diabetes mellitus, and exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus have been reported during postmarketing studies in HIV-infected patients receiving protease inhibitors.
In some cases, diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred.
No causal relationship has been established.
Very common (10% or more): Increased GGT (up to 29%), increased ALT (up to 11%)Common (1% to 10%): Increased AST, hepatitis (including increased AST, ALT, GGT), increased total bilirubinUncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Hepatomegaly, cholangitis, hepatic steatosis, hyperbilirubinemiaFrequency not reported: Fatty liver deposit, cytolytic hepatitis, liver tenderness, hepatic failure, cholecystitis, hepatic dysfunctionPostmarketing reports: Jaundice
Increased GGT (greater than 300 units/L), ALT (greater than 215 units/L), AST (greater than 180 units/L), and total bilirubin (greater than 3.
48 mg/dL) have been reported in up to 29%, up to 11%, up to 10%, and 1% of patients, respectively.
Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminases before initiation of therapy may be at an increased risk for developing further transaminase elevations or liver decompensation.
There have been reports of hepatic dysfunction with some cases leading to death.
A causal relationship with this drug has not been proven since these cases have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV who also had underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and were taking multiple concomitant medications.
