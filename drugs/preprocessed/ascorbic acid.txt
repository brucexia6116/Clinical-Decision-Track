If any of the following side effects occur while taking ascorbic acid, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
Renal side effects have included oxalate and urate kidney stones.
Hyperoxaluria appears to be dose-related.
Migraine headache has been reported with a daily dose of 6 grams.
The manufacturer reports temporary dizziness and faintness may be associated with too rapid of a rate during intravenous administration.
Nervous system side effects have included dizziness, faintness, fatigue, and headache in less than 1% of patients.
Migraine headache has also been reported.
Conditional scurvy is reported to occur following excessive doses of ascorbic acid over a prolonged period of time.
The mechanism of action for this condition is thought to be that large doses of ascorbic acid condition the patient over time for rapid clearance of ascorbic acid resulting in scurvy.
The plasma levels of ascorbic acid appear to remain within normal limits.
The actual existence of conditional scurvy remains controversial.
Other side effects have included flank pain in less than 1% of patients.
Conditional scurvy has also been reported.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and esophagitis.
Nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps appears to be associated with doses exceeding 2 g per day, although there have been some reports with as little as 1 g per day.
