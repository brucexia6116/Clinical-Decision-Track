Other side effects have included iron overload (hemosiderosis).
Secondary hemochromatosis due to prolonged iron ingestion has been reported rarely.
Iron overload (i.
e.
, hemosiderosis) has been reported in patients genetically predisposed, or have underlying disorders, that augment the absorption of iron.
It has also occurred following administration of excessive parenteral iron therapy, combination of oral and parenteral iron, or in patients with hemoglobinopathies that were erroneously diagnosed as iron deficiency anemia.
Hemosiderosis is treated with repeated phlebotomy or long-term administration of deferoxamine.
The liver is particularly susceptible to toxicity in iron-overload states.
