As well as its needed effects, lesinurad (the active ingredient contained in Zurampic) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some lesinurad side effects may not need any medical attention.

The more common side effects include increased serum creatinine, headache, influenza, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
When used at labeled doses in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), serum creatinine increases of  to less than  times or  times or greater from baseline occurred in  (n=/) and  (n=/) of patients, respectively.
Increased serum creatinine levels resolved in most patients (up to ) without treatment interruption.
Based on baseline renal function, serum creatinine increases occurred in , , and  of patients with normal (CrCl greater than  mL/min), mild (CrCl  to less than  mL/min), or moderate (CrCl greater than  to less than  mL/min) renal impairment.
Use at higher than approved doses with or without an XOI resulted in increased serum creatinine levels.
Consistently, patients receiving  mg daily as monotherapy experienced a higher incidence of renal failure.
Nephrolithiasis occurred more frequently in patients receiving  mg daily in combination with an XOI  compared to labeled doses in combination with an XOI .
