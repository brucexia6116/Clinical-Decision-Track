Commonly reported side effects of sertraline include: diarrhea, dizziness, drowsiness, dyspepsia, fatigue, insomnia, loose stools, nausea, tremor, headache, paresthesia, anorexia, decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, diaphoresis, ejaculation failure, and xerostomia.
Other side effects include: abdominal pain, agitation, pain, vomiting, anxiety, hypouricemia, and malaise.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, sertraline may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some sertraline side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most commonly reported side effect was nausea, which was dose dependent and often transient in nature.
The most common side effects associated with discontinuation of sertraline treatment at an incidence at least twice that for placebo and at least  for sertraline in clinical trials included abdominal pain, agitation, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, dyspepsia, ejaculation failure, fatigue, headache, hot flushes, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, palpitation, somnolence, and tremor.
The overall profile of side effects in pediatric clinical trials was generally similar to that seen in adult studies.
Fever, hyperkinesia, urinary incontinence, aggressive reaction, sinusitis, epistaxis, and purpura were reported in clinical trials in pediatric patients at an incidence of at least  and at a rate of at least twice that of placebo.
In clinical trials in children and adolescents aged  to  years with major depressive disorder, the incidence of discontinuation due to side effects was reported at ; the most common reactions leading to discontinuation were agitation, suicidal ideation, hyperkinesia, suicide attempt, and aggravated depression.
Antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.
An increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged  to  years) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders has been reported with short-term use of antidepressant drugs.
Adult and pediatric patients receiving antidepressants for MDD, as well as for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric indications, have reported symptoms that may be precursors to emerging suicidality, including anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania.
Causality has not been established.
In a -week placebo-controlled study in pediatric patients with OCD, side effects observed at an incidence of at least  and at a statistically significant increased level for sertraline compared with placebo were insomnia and agitation in  to  year olds, and insomnia in  to  year olds.
In clinical trials in children and adolescents aged  to  years with major depressive disorder, agitation was reported at a frequency of at least  and at least twice that of placebo.
Suicide attempt was reported in the same number of patients in the sertraline ( out of ) and placebo ( out of ) groups.
Suicide ideation was reported by  sertraline-treated patients and no placebo-treated patients; however the difference was not statistically significant.
Mania, affect lability were also commonly reported in controlled trials in pediatric patients.

In clinical trials in children and adolescents aged  to  years with major depressive disorder, hyperkinesia and tremor were reported at a frequency of at least  and at least twice that of placebo.
Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs as monotherapy, but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs and drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin.
Signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome included agitation, confusion, diaphoresis, diarrhea, fever, hypertension, rigidity, and tachycardia and were in some cases associated with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs.
Common ( to ): Chest pain, palpitations Uncommon ( to ): Edema, dependent edema, flushing, generalized edema, hot flush, hypertension, hypotension, peripheral edema, peripheral ischemia, postural dizziness, postural hypotension, tachycardiaRare (less than ): Aggravated hypertension, bradycardia, cardiac disorder, myocardial infarction, pallor, precordial chest pain, substernal chest pain, vasodilation, vasodilation procedurePostmarketing reports: Atrial arrhythmias, AV block, QT-interval prolongation, vasculitis, ventricular tachycardia (including torsade de pointes)

There are two cases in the literature in which the use of Lactobacillus acidophilus capsules were reported to have been very helpful in the treatment of persistent, sertraline-induced diarrhea.
A study of , antidepressant users has reported  times more upper GI bleeding episodes with the use of SSRIs relative to the population who did not receive antidepressant medications.
Upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was observed in  times more frequently in patients receiving sertraline.
In clinical trials in children and adolescents aged  to  years with major depressive disorder diarrhea, vomiting, and dry mouth were reported at a frequency of at least  and at least twice that of placebo.
The results of one study appear to indicate that treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may cause an increase in serum total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and/or LDL cholesterol.
However, additional studies are necessary to confirm these findings.
Numerous cases of hyponatremia have been reported following treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
Risk factors for the development of SSRI- associated hyponatremia including advanced age, female gender, concomitant use of diuretics, low body weight, and lower baseline serum sodium levels have been identified.
Hyponatremia tends to develop within the first few weeks of treatment (range  to  days) and typically resolves within  weeks (range  hours to  weeks) after therapy has been discontinued with some patients requiring treatment.
The proposed mechanism for the development of hyponatremia involves the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) via release of antidiuretic hormone.
In clinical trials in children and adolescents aged  to  years with major depressive disorder, anorexia was reported at a frequency of at least  and at least twice that of placebo.
In a -week placebo-controlled study in pediatric patients with OCD, anorexia was observed at an incidence of at least  and at a statistically significant increased level for sertraline compared with placebo in  to  year olds.

In placebo-controlled trials ejaculation failure (primarily delayed ejaculation) in men was reported as a treatment-emergent side effect in  of men taking sertraline, compared to  in the placebo group.
The estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance may underestimate their actual incidence, partly because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss this issue.
In clinical trials in children and adolescents aged  to  years with major depressive disorder urinary incontinence was reported at a frequency of at least  and at least twice that of placebo.
Very common ( or more): Ejaculation failureCommon ( to ): Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, impotence, menstrual irregularities, other male/female sexual dysfunction, urinary retention, vaginal hemorrhageUncommon ( to ): Albuminuria, amenorrhea, cystitis, dysmenorrhea, dysuria, menstrual disorder, intermenstrual bleeding, leukorrhea, micturition disorder, nocturia, pollakiuria, polyuria, urinary incontinenceRare (less than ): Abnormal semen, acute female mastitis, atrophic vulvovaginitis, balanoposthitis, breast enlargement, female breast pain, galactorrhea, genital discharge, gynecomastia, hematuria, increased libido, menorrhagia, oliguria, premature ejaculation, priapism, strangury, urinary hesitation Postmarketing reports: Enuresis

Endocrine side effects including two cases of galactorrhea have been reported in association with sertraline therapy.
Two cases of breast discomfort and enlargement without galactorrhea have also been reported.
Case reports have suggested that sertraline, like other serotonin- specific reuptake inhibitors, may induce the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
Seven cases of hyponatremia have been reported, four of which were associated with SIADH.
Six of the seven patients were over  years of age.
