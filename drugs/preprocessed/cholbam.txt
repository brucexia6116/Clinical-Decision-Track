The most common adverse reactions have included diarrhea, reflux esophagitis, malaise, jaundice, skin lesions, nausea, abdominal pain, intestinal polyp, urinary tract infection, and peripheral neuropathy.
Ten patients, five with single enzyme defect (SED) and  with peroxisomal disorders (PD) experienced worsening transaminases, elevated bilirubin values, or worsening cholestasis on liver biopsy during treatment.
Of these  patients, five ( SED and  PD) had liver impairment at baseline while the other  did not have baseline cholestasis, but experienced exacerbation of liver disease while on treatment.
Exacerbation by this drug could not be ruled out.
Deaths attributed to progression of underlying liver disease were reported in  patients aged  year or less in trial  (SED, n=; PD, n=); three patients had AKRD deficiency,  had beta-HSD and  had CYPA deficiency.
Of the  patients in trial  with PDs including Zellweger spectrum disorders,  patients aged  months to  years died;  of the  deaths were attributed to progression of underlying liver disease or a worsening of their primary illness.
Two additional deaths in trial  were both patients who had been off study medication for more than  year; their deaths were most likely due to a progression of their underlying liver disease.
In trial  (SED, n=; PD, n=)  patients with SED died; cause of death was unrelated to their primary treatment or progression of their underlying liver disease.
Four patients between the ages of  and  years with PD died ( new patient and  who rolled over from trial ); cause of death in  of these  patients was attributed to progression of underlying liver disease or worsening of their primary illness.
One patient with  beta-HSD deficiency developed symptomatic cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy.
Gallstones have been reported after long-term therapy.
