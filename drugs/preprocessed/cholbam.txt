The most common adverse reactions have included diarrhea, reflux esophagitis, malaise, jaundice, skin lesions, nausea, abdominal pain, intestinal polyp, urinary tract infection, and peripheral neuropathy.
Ten patients, five with single enzyme defect (SED) and 5 with peroxisomal disorders (PD) experienced worsening transaminases, elevated bilirubin values, or worsening cholestasis on liver biopsy during treatment.
Of these 10 patients, five (3 SED and 2 PD) had liver impairment at baseline while the other 5 did not have baseline cholestasis, but experienced exacerbation of liver disease while on treatment.
Exacerbation by this drug could not be ruled out.
Deaths attributed to progression of underlying liver disease were reported in 5 patients aged 1 year or less in trial 1 (SED, n=50; PD, n=29); three patients had AKR1D1 deficiency, 1 had 3beta-HSD and 1 had CYP7A1 deficiency.
Of the 29 patients in trial 1 with PDs including Zellweger spectrum disorders, 12 patients aged 7 months to 2.
5 years died; 8 of the 12 deaths were attributed to progression of underlying liver disease or a worsening of their primary illness.
Two additional deaths in trial 1 were both patients who had been off study medication for more than 1 year; their deaths were most likely due to a progression of their underlying liver disease.
In trial 2 (SED, n=31; PD, n=12) 2 patients with SED died; cause of death was unrelated to their primary treatment or progression of their underlying liver disease.
Four patients between the ages of 4 and 8 years with PD died (1 new patient and 3 who rolled over from trial 1); cause of death in 3 of these 4 patients was attributed to progression of underlying liver disease or worsening of their primary illness.
One patient with 3 beta-HSD deficiency developed symptomatic cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy.
Gallstones have been reported after long-term therapy.
