Common side effects of Bethkis include: voice disorder.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Very common ( or more):-TOBI(R): Headache -TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Headache , hypoacusis Common ( to ):-TOBI(R): Tinnitus (up to )-TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Tinnitus , deafness including unilateral deafness (reported as mild to moderate hearing loss or increased hearing loss; )Uncommon ( to ):-TOBI(R): Deafness including unilateral deafness (reported as mild to moderate hearing loss or increased hearing loss; )Rare (less than ):-Neuromuscular blockadeFrequency not reported:-Parenteral: Neurotoxicity, eighth-nerve impairment (auditory and vestibular ototoxicity), cochlear hair cell damage, dizziness, vertigo, roaring in ears, hearing loss, numbness, skin tingling, muscle twitching, convulsions, headache-Inhalation: Transient tinnitus, tinnitus, hearing loss, headache, ototoxicityPostmarketing reports:-Inhalation: Hearing loss, tinnitus, aphonia, dysgeusia
Parenteral: Ototoxicity may have included loss of auditory or vestibular function secondary to cochlear hair cell damage.
Partial or total auditory changes were irreversible and usually bilateral; deafness may have continued to develop after drug was stopped.
Eighth-nerve impairment primarily occurred in patients with preexisting renal damage, with normal renal function treated for longer periods and/or at higher doses than recommended, who previously received an ototoxic agent, and who were dehydrated.
Risk of drug-induced hearing loss increased with extent of exposure to high peak or high trough serum levels.
Ototoxicity may be less likely when tobramycin serum trough levels are less than  mg/L after parenteral administration.
Inhalation: Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity.
Some patients who concurrently received, or previously had prolonged therapy with, parenteral aminoglycosides reported hearing loss.
Rare neurologic side effects have included neuromuscular blockade, particularly in patients who were predisposed, including patients with myasthenia gravis, hypocalcemia, and those receiving a neuromuscular blocking agent.
Headache has been reported in patients using inhaled tobramycin with ciprofloxacin for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
Rare (less than ):-Inhalation: Acute renal failureFrequency not reported:-Parenteral: Nephrotoxicity (usually reversible), renal function changes, rising BUN, rising non-protein nitrogen, rising serum creatinine, oliguria, cylindruria, increased proteinuria
Nephrotoxicity primarily occurred in patients with preexisting renal damage and in patients with normal renal function treated for longer periods and/or at higher doses than recommended.
Predisposing factors also included advanced age, dehydration, and concomitant use of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs.
The overall incidence of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity was  to , and increased if tobramycin trough levels exceeded  mg/L.
One study showed that hyperbilirubinemia in patients with biliary obstruction predisposed to aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.
A -year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including chronic renal insufficiency, was started on inhaled tobramycin for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
The patient continued inhaled tobramycin for  days, during which her serum creatinine gradually rose.
After reaching a serum creatinine level of  mg/dL, the inhaled tobramycin was discontinued on day  and the patient was started on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure.
Very common ( or more):-Bethkis(R): Decreased forced expiratory volume , rales -TOBI(R): Cough , lung disorder (including pulmonary or cystic fibrosis exacerbations; ), productive cough , dyspnea , hemoptysis , oropharyngeal pain -TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Cough (up to ), lung disorder (including pulmonary or cystic fibrosis exacerbations; ), productive cough , dyspnea , oropharyngeal pain , dysphonia (up to ), hemoptysis , pharyngolaryngeal pain Common ( to ):-Bethkis(R): Dysphonia , wheezing , epistaxis , pharyngolaryngeal pain , bronchitis , tonsillitis -TOBI(R): Upper respiratory tract infection , decreased pulmonary function test , nasal congestion , rales , wheezing , laryngitis , voice alteration/dysphonia , chest discomfort , throat irritation , epistaxis , decreased forced expiratory volume , sputum discoloration-TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Nasal congestion , rales , wheezing , upper respiratory tract infection , decreased pulmonary function test , chest discomfort , throat irritation , decreased forced expiratory volume , epistaxis , bronchospasm Uncommon ( to ):-TOBI(R): Bronchospasm , rhinitis, decreased lung functionFrequency not reported:-Inhalation: Wheeze, cough, dyspneaPostmarketing reports:-Inhalation: Bronchospasm, oropharyngeal pain
Decreased lung function included reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration.
Bronchospasm has been reported with nebulized tobramycin in cystic fibrosis patients.
To help prevent bronchospasm, a bronchodilator should be used in conjunction with nebulized tobramycin.
The preserved parenteral formulation has been associated with more bronchospasm than the preservative-free solution for inhalation.
Wheeze, cough, and dyspnea have been reported in patients using inhaled tobramycin with ciprofloxacin for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
Rare (less than ):-Parenteral: Serious allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions), allergic-type reactions (including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes)-Hypersensitivity reactions (including eosinophilia, pruritus, fever, rash, exfoliative dermatitis)Frequency not reported:-Cross-sensitivity among aminoglycosidesPostmarketing reports:-Inhalation: Hypersensitivity
Severe and sometimes fatal allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis and dermatologic reactions including exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) have been reported rarely.
The sodium metabisulfite preservative in some formulations may cause allergic-type reactions (including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes) in some susceptible patients.
Contact dermatitis in a patient using tobramycin-containing ear drops has been reported.
A case of exfoliative dermatitis was associated with IV and intraperitoneal tobramycin (the active ingredient contained in Bethkis) 
Common ( to ):-TOBI(R): Rash -TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Rash Rare (less than ):-Parenteral: Exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome-Contact dermatitis (at least  case)Frequency not reported:-Parenteral: Rash, itching, urticariaPostmarketing reports:-Inhalation: Pruritus, urticaria, rash
Toxic trough levels have been reported with nebulized tobramycin (the active ingredient contained in Bethkis) administered by positive pressure ventilation to a patient with renal dysfunction.
No symptoms of toxicity were noted.
Fatigue has been reported in patients using inhaled tobramycin with ciprofloxacin for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
Very common ( or more):-TOBI(R): Pyrexia -TOBI(R) Podhaler(TM): Pyrexia Uncommon ( to ):-TOBI(R): MalaiseFrequency not reported:-Parenteral: Fever-Inhalation: Toxic trough levels, fatigue
Nausea has been reported in patients using inhaled tobramycin (the active ingredient contained in Bethkis) with ciprofloxacin for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

Common ( to ):-Bethkis(R): Increased red blood cell sedimentation rate , eosinophilia Frequency not reported:-Parenteral: Anemia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia
Renal tubular toxicity may have resulted in renal magnesium wasting, which may have resulted in hypocalcemia (due to magnesium-dependent parathormone secretion) and clinical tetany in rare cases.

Rare (less than ):-DeliriumFrequency not reported:-Parenteral: Lethargy, mental confusion, disorientation
A rare case of delirium has been reported in a patient who was receiving tobramycin, but there was concomitant opiate administration and underlying infection, which makes implication of tobramycin difficult.
