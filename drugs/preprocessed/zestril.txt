As well as its needed effects, lisinopril (the active ingredient contained in Zestril) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some lisinopril side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
