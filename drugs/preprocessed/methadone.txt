Common (1% to 10%): Sedation, drowsinessFrequency not reported: Headache, seizures, confusion, disorientation, lightheadedness
Cases of QT interval prolongation and Torsades de pointes have occurred during treatment; these cases appear to be more commonly associated with higher dose treatment (greater than 200 mg per day).
There have been some cases in patients receiving lower doses and in these cases contributing factors such as concomitant medications and/or clinical conditions were present.
In vivo studies have confirmed this drug effects the QT interval and in vitro studies have shown it inhibits cardiac potassium channels.
