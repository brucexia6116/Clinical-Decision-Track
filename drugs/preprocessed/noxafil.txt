As well as its needed effects, posaconazole (the active ingredient contained in Noxafil) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking posaconazole, check with your doctor immediately:
Some posaconazole side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Thrombophlebitis was very common when multiple doses of the injection were administered via peripheral venous catheter, leading to administration via central venous catheter in later studies.

The most common side effects reported with the oral suspension in the prophylaxis clinical trials were fever, diarrhea, and nausea.
The most common side effects leading to discontinuation of the oral suspension in these trials were associated with gastrointestinal disorders, including nausea , vomiting , and increased liver enzymes .
The most common side effects reported with the oral suspension in the oropharyngeal candidiasis and refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis trials were fever, diarrhea, nausea, headache, vomiting, and coughing.
The most common side effects leading to discontinuation of the oral suspension were respiratory impairment  and pneumonia  in patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis and AIDS  and respiratory impairment  in patients with refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis.
