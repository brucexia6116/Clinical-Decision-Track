Other side effects include: asthenia, blurred vision, dizziness, dyspepsia, fatigue, hypertension, increased blood pressure, increased creatine phosphokinase, and restlessness.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most frequently reported adverse effects were extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, dyspepsia, vomiting, somnolence, and restlessness.
Very common ( or more): Extrapyramidal symptoms , akathisia , headache Common ( to ): Dizziness, somnolence, dystonia, ParkinsonismRare (less than ): Ischemic stroke
During  week schizophrenia placebo controlled trials,  of patients reported extrapyramidal symptoms, excluding akathisia and restlessness in the cariprazine group.
This led to study discontinuation in  of patients.
Akathisia occurred in  of patients, leading to study discontinuation of .
In  week bipolar mania placebo controlled trials,  of cariprazine treated patients experienced extrapyramidal symptoms, excluding akathisia and restlessness.
This led to study discontinuation in  of patients.
Akathisia occurred in  of patients, leading to study discontinuation of .
Hyperglycemia/Diabetes Mellitus: In long-term, open label studies in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,  of patients with normal baseline hemoglobin Ac developed elevated levels (HbAc  or higher).
In short-term trials, the number of patients with shifts from normal fasting glucose (less than  mg/dL) to high (greater than  mg/dL) and borderline ( to less than  mg/dL) levels were similar to placebo-treated patients.
Dyslipidemia: In the  week placebo controlled bipolar mania and  week placebo controlled schizophrenia trials, the shifts in fasting total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides were similar in treatment and placebo groups.
Weight gain: In the  week placebo controlled trial of patients with schizophrenia, a  weight increase or greater was observed in  of the patients receiving  mg to  mg of drug daily (n=),  of patients receiving  mg to  mg daily (n=), and  in the  mg to  mg once daily group (n=).
During a long term, uncontrolled trial in patients with schizophrenia, the mean change from baseline weight at  weeks was  kg.
Common ( to ): Decreased appetite, weight gain, increase in blood creatine phosphokinase, hyperglycemiaInfrequent: Hyponatremia, diabetes mellitusFrequency not reported: Dyslipidemia
In  placebo controlled trials, during a three week period of treating bipolar mania (n=), there was no clinically significant difference between cariprazine and placebo treated patients regarding changes from baseline to endpoint supine blood pressure parameters.
There was however, an increase in supine diastolic blood pressure in the  to  mg orally once a day cariprazine treated patients.
Common ( to ): Tachycardia, hypertensionUncommon ( to ): Orthostatic hypotension
Common ( to ): RashInfrequent: Hyperhidrosis

Frequency not reported: Leukopenia, neutropenia, agranulocytosis
Transaminase elevations  times the upper limit of normal or greater occurred in  to  of patients in the cariprazine group during  week schizophrenia trials; the incidence increased with dose.
Elevations occurred in  to  of patients during  week bipolar mania trials.
Uncommon ( to ): Increase in hepatic enzymesRare (less than ): Hepatitis
Common ( to ): Urinary tract infectionInfrequent: Pollakiuria
Frequency not reported: Rash, pruritus, urticaria, swollen lips/tongue, face and pharyngeal edema, swelling of the face
