The most commonly reported adverse reactions included diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, weight loss, and tremor; the most common serious adverse reaction was peripheral neuropathy; diarrhea and tremor were the side effects that most commonly required intervention.
Osmotic diarrhea appears to be due to inhibitory activity of miglustat on intestinal disaccharidases leading to reduced absorption of dietary disaccharides in the small intestine.
Diarrhea decreased over time with continued therapy.
Very common ( or more): Diarrhea (including osmotic diarrhea; up to ), abdominal pain (up to ), flatulence (up to ), nausea (up to ), vomiting (up to )Common ( to ): Constipation, dry mouth, dyspepsia, epigastric pain not food-related, bloating, stomach pain, gas, abdominal distension/discomfortFrequency not reported: Dysphagia, indigestion, dry mouth
Weight loss has been observed in approximately  to  of patients.
Peak weight loss occurs between  and  months, with a mean weight loss of  to  of body weight.
It is unclear if weight loss results from the diarrhea and associated gastrointestinal complaints, a decrease in food intake, or a combination of these or other factors.
There is a trend to return to baseline weight after the first year.
Very common ( or more): Weight decrease (up to )Common ( to ): Anorexia
Very common ( or more): Tremor/exacerbation of existing tremor (about ), headache (up to ), tremor (up to ), dizziness (up to )Common ( to ): Unsteady gait, paresthesia, migraine, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, hypoesthesiaFrequency not reported: Gait abnormal, gait spastic, hyperreflexia
The most common serious adverse reaction in clinical trials was peripheral neuropathy.
Tremor, and worsening tremor were very commonly reported.
Compared to the general population, patients with type  Gaucher disease are more likely to have peripheral neuropathy.
A patient should be evaluated for tremor and neuropathy prior to starting therapy.
