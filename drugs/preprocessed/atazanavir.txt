In healthy volunteers and patients, abnormalities in AV conduction were asymptomatic and generally limited to first-degree AV block.
A -year-old HIV-infected woman with congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of  started lamivudine, zidovudine, and atazanavir.
One month later, the patient presented with syncope and complained of nausea, which had begun  days prior.
During the month after therapy initiation, the patient experienced slowly progressive shortness of breath.
An ECG showed a QTc interval prolongation of  min.
Prior to starting antiretroviral therapy, an ECG showed a QTc interval of  min for the patient.
The patient developed continuous ventricular tachycardia and was defibrillated to sinus bradycardia, which worsened her QT interval prolongation.
The patient developed torsades de pointes, which reverted after further defibrillation.
Treatment to increase her heart rate and decrease her QT interval was started.
The patient's antiretroviral therapy was discontinued during her hospitalization and was not restarted due to concerns regarding QT prolongation.
The patient's QTc interval decreased to  min and she had no additional ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
The patient was restarted on lamivudine, zidovudine, and atazanavir and within  days, ECG showed QTc interval prolongation to  min.
The atazanavir was concluded to be the cause of the prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes.
The patient's QT interval returned to normal following discontinuation of her antiretroviral therapy.

Uncommon ( to ): Interstitial nephritisRare (less than ): Acute interstitial nephritis, renal colic, reversible acute renal failure, urolithiasis, kidney painPostmarketing reports: Nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, renal insufficiency
An analysis of a ureteral stone determined it was  atazanavir metabolite and  calcium phosphate (carbonate apatite).

Analysis of renal calculi from additional patients determined concentrations of atazanavir ranging from  to .
