Elevated ALT and AST were reported in 8% and 6% of therapy-experienced INSTI-experienced patients, respectively.
The rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher patients coinfected with hepatitis B and/or C virus.
ALT abnormalities (Grade 2 to 4) in hepatitis B and/or C coinfected patients compared with HIV monoinfected patients were reported in 16% versus 2% with 50 mg once a day and 8% versus 7% with 50 mg twice a day.
Liver chemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were reported in some patients with hepatitis B and/or C at the start of dolutegravir therapy, especially when antihepatitis therapy was stopped.
Common (1% to 10%): Elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated total bilirubin, hepatitisFrequency not reported: Liver chemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome

Common (1% to 10%): Pruritus, rash (includes rash, generalized rash, macular rash, maculopapular rash, pruritic rash, drug eruption)
Increased serum creatinine occurred due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function.
Increased serum creatinine was reported within the first 4 weeks of therapy and remained stable through 24 to 48 weeks.
A mean change of 0.
11 mg/dL (range of -0.
6 to 0.
62 mg/dL) was reported after 48 weeks of therapy in therapy-naive patients.
Common (1% to 10%): Renal impairmentFrequency not reported: Increased serum creatinine (due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine)
Common (1% to 10%): Fatigue
Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Hypersensitivity reactions (characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes organ dysfunction, including liver injury)
Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Immune reconstitution syndrome, autoimmune disorders in the setting of immune reconstitution (e.
g.
, Graves' disease, polymyositis, Guillain-Barre syndrome)
