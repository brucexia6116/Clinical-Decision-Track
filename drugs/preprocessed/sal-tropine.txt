Side effects include:
Most adverse effects are manifestations of pharmacologic effects at muscarinic-cholinergic receptors and usually are reversible when therapy is discontinued.
Severity and frequency of adverse effects are dose related and individual intolerance varies greatly; adverse effects occasionally may be obviated by a reduction in dosage but this also may eliminate potential therapeutic effects.

Frequent effects include xerostomia (dry mouth), dry skin, blurred vision, cycloplegia, mydriasis, photophobia, anhidrosis, urinary hesitancy and retention, tachycardia, palpitation, xerophthalmia, and constipation,      which may appear at therapeutic or subtherapeutic doses.
Xerostomia is the dose-limiting effect.
Other common effects include increased ocular tension (especially in patients with angle-closure glaucoma), loss of taste, headache, nervousness, restlessness, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, flushing, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, bloated feeling, anhidrosis (especially in hot environments),    fever,  mild to moderate pain at the injection site,   loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction (via block of cholinergically mediated vasodilation).

Although individual reactions vary greatly, systemic doses are likely to produce the following effects: mg: Slight dryness of the nose and mouth, bradycardia mg: Greater dryness of nose and mouth with thirst; slowing, then acceleration of the heart; slight mydriasis mg: Very dry mouth, tachycardia with palpitations, mydriasis, slight blurring of near vision mg: Increase in the above symptoms plus disturbance of speech, difficulty swallowing, headache, hot, dry skin, restlessness with asthenia mg and over: Above symptoms to extreme degrees, plus ataxia, excitement, disorientation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma mg: May be fatal
