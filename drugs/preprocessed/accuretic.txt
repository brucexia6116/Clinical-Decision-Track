Common ( to ): Dry cough, rhinitis, upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, pharyngitisUncommon ( to ):Rare (less than ): Pneumonia, asthma, respiratory infiltration, lung disorder, acute noncardiogenic pulmonary edemaFrequency not reported: Rash, acute pulmonary edema, interstitial cystitis
Patients with renal artery stenosis maintain glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, which is blocked by quinapril.
Although quinapril may be associated with a rise in serum creatinine and BUN, GFR has been shown to remain unchanged or improve in most patients.
HCTZ has been used to treat nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
However, a case in which the drug was believed to have caused this condition has been reported.
Frequency not reported: New or worsened renal insufficiency (especially in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency or who are angiotensin-dependent, such as those with CHF)Quinapril:Frequency not reported: Acute renal failure, new onset proteinuriaHydrochlorothiazide:Rare (less than ): Interstitial nephritis
Common ( to ): Vasodilation, vertigo, chest painUncommon ( to ): Palpitations, tachycardiaRare (less than ): Heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hypertensive crisis, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac rhythm disturbanceFrequency not reported: Hydrochlorothiazide-induced hypokalemia can predispose some patients to various cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular ectopy and complete AV heart blockPostmarketing reports: Bradycardia, cor pulmonale, vasculitis, deep thrombosis
Hypotension is most likely in patients who are sodium and intravascular volume depleted.
Patients with intestinal angioedema generally present with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting) and in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema, and C- esterase levels were normal.
These symptoms resolve after stopping the ACE inhibitor.
.
There have been approximately  known cases of thiazide-induced pulmonary edema, encompassing  episodes of pulmonary edema, as of  (per a  review).
In some cases, doses as small as  mg were associated with the development of pulmonary edema.
The average time to onset of this adverse reaction was  minutes, women have a relative risk of :, and the average age was  years.
The mortality rate was .
Some experts consider this side effect grossly underreported.
Quinapril:Rare (less than ): Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or pharynx, intestinal angioedemaHydrochlorothiazide:Uncommon ( to ): Rash, anaphylaxis
Common ( to ): Headache, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, somnolence, astheniaPostmarketing reports: Speech disorder, meningism, amnesia
Quinapril:Rare (less than ): Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or pharynx, intestinal angioedemaHydrochlorothiazide: Frequency not reported: Metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, elevated serum uric acid levels, increased serum cholesterol
HCTZ may increase total serum cholesterol by , LDL lipoprotein cholesterol by , and VLDL lipoprotein cholesterol levels by , as well as reduce insulin secretion.
It should be used with caution in patients with diabetes or hypercholesterolemia.
Hyperuricemia may be an important consideration in patients with a history of gout.
Hypophosphatemia and low serum magnesium concentrations may also occur, but are usually clinically insignificant except in malnourished patients.
Quinapril:Rare (less than ): Neutropenia, bone marrow depressionHydrochlorothiazide:Very rare (less than ): Immune complex hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia
Thiazide diuretics may increase serum cholesterol and triglycerides, resulting in an increased risk of cholesterol gallstone formation.
Reports of bowel strictures associated with thiazide ingestion were reported in the 's (although patients in these reports were on a combination HCTZ-potassium product).
Common ( to ): Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsiaUncommon ( to ): Dry mouth, gastrointestinal hemorrhageHydrochlorothiazide:Rare (less than ): Pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis
Hydrochlorothiazide:Rare (less than ): A distinct entity with clinical and laboratory features indistinguishable from those of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pruritus, increased sweating, erythema, alopecia, pemphigusFrequency not reported: Erythema annular centrifugum, acute eczematous dermatitis, morbilliform or leukocytoclastic vasculitis, phototoxic dermatitisPostmarketing reports: Urticaria, maculopapular rash, petechiae
A prospective study of  patients who received oral thiazide diuretics for  years without interruption revealed an increased mean fasting blood glucose level after treatment.
Withdrawal of thiazide therapy for seven months in  of the patients resulted in mean reductions of  in fasting blood glucose and  in the -hour glucose tolerance test value.
A control group was not reported.
Hydrochlorothiazide:Frequency not reported: Glucose intolerance and a potentially deleterious effect on the lipid profile (either of which may be important in some patients with or at risk for diabetes or coronary artery disease)
Rare (less than ): Myalgias, chills, myopathy, myositis, muscle spasm, back pain, arthritisPostmarketing reports: Paralysis, hemiplegia, abnormal gait
Rare (less than ): Impotence in male patients, interstitial cystitis
Hydrochlorothiazide:Rare (less than ): Acute transient myopia, acute angle-closure glaucoma
Hydrochlorothiazide:Frequency not reported: Interstitial nephritis
