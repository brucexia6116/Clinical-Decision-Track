Commonly reported side effects of sebelipase alfa include: diarrhea, fever, vomiting, hypersensitivity reaction, and urticaria.
Other side effects include: nausea.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, sebelipase alfa may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some sebelipase alfa side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Common ( to ): Tachycardia, hyperemia, hypotensionRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Tachycardia, hypertension, pallor, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate
Common ( to ): Urticaria, rash, pruritus, eczema, papular rash, pruritic rashRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Urticaria , rash, eczema, pruritus, maculopapular rash
Constipation and nausea were each reported in  of pediatric and adult patients receiving this drug, compared to  and  of those receiving placebo, respectively.
Common ( to ): Nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, constipationRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Diarrhea , vomiting , gastroesophageal reflux disease, retching
In clinical trials,  patients (total) were treated with this drug.
In  pediatric and adult patients with lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) deficiency,  patients received this drug ( mg/kg IV every other week) while  patients received placebo during the double-blind period of the trial; age at first dose was  to  years.
Infants with evidence of rapidly progressive LAL deficiency before  months of age (n=) received up to  mg/kg IV once a week; age at first dose was  to  months.
The most serious side effects reported in clinical studies were signs/symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis (including chest discomfort, conjunctival injection, dyspnea, generalized and itchy rash, hyperemia, mild eyelid edema, rhinorrhea, severe respiratory distress, tachycardia, tachypnea, urticaria).
Common ( to ): Urinary tract infection, menorrhagia
Rapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Anemia 
Very common ( or more): Hypersensitivity reactionCommon ( to ): Anaphylactic reactionRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Hypersensitivity reaction, anaphylaxis
In clinical trials, signs/symptoms of anaphylaxis were reported in  of  patients treated with this drug (including  of  children and adults and  of  infants).
Anaphylaxis was reported during infusion up to  year after the start of therapy.
In clinical trials, signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction were reported in  of  patients treated with this drug (including  of  children and adults and  of  infants); such signs/symptoms occurred in at least  patients and included abdominal pain, agitation, chills, diarrhea, eczema, hypertension, irritability, laryngeal edema, nausea, edema, pallor, pruritus, pyrexia/increased body temperature, rash, tachycardia, urticaria, and vomiting.
Most reactions occurred during or within  hours of completing the infusion.
During a double-blind study,  out of  pediatric and adult patients treated with this drug developed ADA.
During the open-label extension,  patients developed in vitro neutralizing antibodies.
ADA developed in  of  patients with rapidly progressive LAL deficiency presenting with the first  months of life;  of the  ADA-positive patients were positive for neutralizing antibodies.
Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in all  ADA-positive patients compared to  of the  ADA-negative patients.
Decreased growth velocity (in a setting of neutralizing antibodies to this drug) was reported in  patient.
There was no clear association between the development of ADA and decreased efficacy of this drug.
Very common ( or more): Antidrug antibody developmentCommon ( to ): Neutralizing antibody developmentRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Development of antidrug antibodies (ADA), positive for neutralizing antibodies
Very common ( or more): Increased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, increased triglyceridesCommon ( to ): Transient hypercholesterolemia, transient hypertriglyceridemiaRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Decreased oxygen saturation
Increases in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) and triglycerides above pretreatment levels were observed in  of  and  of  patients, respectively, at  and  weeks following initiation of this drug.
The maximum mean percentage increase for LDL-c at week  was  and  for triglycerides at week   These increases generally improved within an additional  weeks of therapy.
Very common ( or more): Headache Common ( to ): DizzinessRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Hypotonia
Common ( to ): Eyelid edemaRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Eyelid edema
Very common ( or more): Fever/pyrexia Common ( to ): Chills, chest discomfort, edema, fatigue, increased body temperature, infusion site induration, infusion related reaction, astheniaRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Fever/pyrexia , increased body temperature, decreased oxygen saturation, chills, edema, hyperthermia, irritability, decreased growth velocity
Common ( to ): Anxiety, insomniaRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Agitation
Very common ( or more): Oropharyngeal pain , nasopharyngitis Common ( to ): Laryngeal edema, dyspneaRapidly Progressive LAL Deficiency:-Very common ( or more): Rhinitis , Nasopharyngitis , Cough , respiratory distress, wheezing, nasal congestion, sneezing, increased respiratory rate
