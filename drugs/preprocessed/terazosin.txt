Ocular side effects including Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) have been observed in some patients undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery while being treated with alpha- blockers.
Most reports were in patients treated with an alpha- blocker at the time IFIS occurred, but in some instances the alpha- blocker had been stopped prior to surgery.
The manufacturer recommends that patients be questioned to determine whether or not they have taken alpha- blockers prior to being considered for cataract surgery.
If it is determined that the patient has taken an alpha- blocker, the patient's ophthalmologist should be prepared for possible modifications to their surgical technique that may be necessary should IFIS be observed during the procedure.

A -year-old white male developed a generalized scaling erythematous rash on the third day after starting terazosin  mg daily for benign prostatic hypertrophy.
The rash was accompanied by mild fever, asthenia, and intense pruritus.
The patient was on no other medications.
Hematologic and histopathologic studies suggested a drug reaction.
Terazosin was discontinued.
Two weeks following oral methylprednisolone ( mg daily) and emollients, symptoms had resolved completely.
