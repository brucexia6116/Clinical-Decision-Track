Common side effects of Saphris include: akathisia, drowsiness, extrapyramidal reaction, headache, and dizziness.
Other side effects include: gastric hypersecretory conditions, hypoesthesia, sialorrhea, and weight gain.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, asenapine (the active ingredient contained in Saphris) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking asenapine, check with your doctor immediately:
Some asenapine side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in adults included akathisia, dizziness, extra pyramidal symptoms other than akathisia, oral hypoesthesia, somnolence, and increased weight.
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients included somnolence, dizziness, dysgeusia, oral paresthesia, nausea, increased appetite, fatigue, and increased weight.
In a dedicated QT study in patients with schizophrenia, doses of , , , and  mg twice a day were compared with placebo.
QTc interval increases ranged from  to  msec.
No patients had QTc increases of  msec or greater, nor did any patient experience a QTc of  msec or greater.
Orthostatic hypotension was reported in  of elderly subjects compared with  in the combined study populations.
Common ( to ): Hypertension, edemaUncommon ( to ): Syncope, sinus bradycardia, bundle branch block, QT prolongation on ECG, sinus tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, hypotensionRare (less than ): Tachycardia
While all atypical antipsychotics have been associated with metabolic changes including hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and weight gain, the degree of metabolic change differs for each agent.
In clinical trials with this drug, changes from baseline in fasting glucose ranged from - to  mg/dL in adults and - to  mg/dL in pediatric patients treated with this drug for  to  weeks compared with - and - mg/dL in adults and pediatric patients receiving placebo, respectively.
In a -week double-blind, comparator-controlled trial in primarily schizophrenic patients, the mean increase in fasting glucose from baseline was  mg/dL.
An increase of  or more in body weight occurred in  to  of adults and  to  of pediatric patients treated with this drug for  weeks compared with  and , respectively in adults and pediatric patients receiving placebo.
In a -week double-blind, comparator-controlled trial in primarily schizophrenic patients, the mean increase in weight from baseline was  kg.
Common ( to ): Weight increased, increased appetiteUncommon ( to ): Hyponatremia, hyperglycemia
Uncommon ( to ): AnemiaRare (less than ): Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia
Common ( to ): DysmenorrheaUncommon ( to ): Sexual dysfunction, amenorrhea Rare (less than ): Gynecomastia, galactorrhea Frequency not reported: Hyperprolactinemia
Frequency not reported: Hypersensitivity to include anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, swollen tongue, dyspnea, wheezing, and rash

Transient elevations in serum transaminases (primarily ALT) in the short-term schizophrenia and bipolar mania trials were more common in treated patients but mean changes were not clinically relevant.
In short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia trials, the mean increase in transaminase levels for asenapine (the active ingredient contained in Saphris) treated patients was  units/L compared to a decrease of  units/L for placebo treated patients.
The proportion of patients with transaminase elevations three or more times the ULN (at the endpoint) was  for asenapine treated patients versus  for placebo treated patients.
In short-term, placebo-controlled bipolar mania trials, the mean increase in transaminase levels for asenapine treated patients was  units/L compared to a decrease of  units/L in placebo treated patients.
The proportion of patients with transaminase elevations three or more times the ULN (at the endpoint) was  for asenapine treated patients versus  for placebo treated patients.
No cases of more severe liver injury were seen.
In a  week, double-blind, comparator controlled trial of patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, the mean increase from baseline of ALT was  units/L.
Common ( to ): Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased
Common ( to ): Muscle rigidity, arthralgia, extremity painRare (less than ): Rhabdomyolysis
Very common ( or greater): Somnolence (pediatric patients; up to ) Common ( to ): Dizziness, somnolence (adults), extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, dyskinesia, dystonia, parkinsonism, sedation, dysgeusia, tremor, headache, dysgeusia, akathisia Uncommon ( to ): Seizure, dysarthria, Rare (less than ): Neuroleptic malignant syndromeFrequency not reported: Restless leg syndrome
Rare (less than ): Accommodation disorder
Common ( to ): Fatigue
Uncommon ( to ): Epistaxis, asthma, rhinorrhea, sinus congestion, nasal drynessRare (less than ): Pulmonary embolismPostmarketing: Choking
Very common ( or greater): Oral paraesthesia (pediatrics, up to ) Common ( to ): Constipation, dry mouth, oral hypoesthesia (adults), salivary hypersecretion, stomach discomfort, vomiting, toothache, dyspepsia, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal painUncommon ( to ): Dysphagia, swollen tongue, glossodyniaPostmarketing reports: Oral ulcers, blisters, peeling/sloughing, and inflammation at the application site, nausea
Application site reactions that include oral ulcers, blisters, peeling/sloughing, and inflammation primarily in the sublingual area have led to discontinuation of therapy in many cases.
Oral hypoesthesia and/or oral paraesthesia may occur directly after administration and usually resolve in  hour.
Common ( to ): Rash
