Cephalexin is generally well-tolerated.
Large studies report an overall 6% incidence of side effects, some of which may not be related to cephalexin (the active ingredient contained in Keflex) 
Hypersensitivity side effects have included fever, urticaria, rash, eosinophilia, anaphylaxis, angioedema, contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute paronychia, and hepatitis.
Up to 20% of patients with a penicillin allergy may be allergic to cephalexin.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, abdominal cramping, anorexia, and anal pruritus.
Diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile colitis has been reported with some cephalosporins.
If diarrhea occurs and it does not resolve with discontinuation of the drug and/or institution of standard antidiarrheal therapy, pseudomembranous colitis should be suspected.
Hepatic side effects have included transient elevations of liver function tests, transient hepatitis, and rare cases of cholestatic jaundice.
Renal side effects have rarely included interstitial nephritis.
Reversible fever, azotemia, pyuria and eosinophiluria are the hallmarks of cephalosporin-induced interstitial nephritis.
Acute tubular necrosis has also been reported.
Hematologic side effects have included eosinophilia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia.
Nervous system side effects have included dizziness, fatigue, headache, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations.
Reversible ototoxicity and vertigo, apparently due to labyrinthine disease, have been reported in a few patients with renal disease.
Genitourinary side effects have included genital pruritus, genital moniliasis, vaginitis, and vaginal discharge.
Musculoskeletal side effects have included arthralgia, arthritis, and joint disorder.
Dermatologic side effects have included urticaria, rash, contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis has been reported.
