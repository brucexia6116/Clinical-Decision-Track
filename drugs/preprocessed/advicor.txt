Lovastatin has been associated with rare cases of severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, manifested as elevations in creatine kinase, myoglobinuria, proteinuria, and renal failure.
These conditions appear to be dose related, usually occurring with doses greater than  mg per day.
Concomitant use of lovastatin-niacin and potent inhibitors of CYP A (i.
e.
, cyclosporine, antifungal azoles, macrolide antibiotics, ketolide antibiotics, HIV protease inhibitors, large amounts of grapefruit juice) or other drugs known to cause myopathy (i.
e.
, gemfibrozil) is associated with an increased risk of myotoxicity.
Myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis have also been reported when lovastatin is used in combination with lipid-altering doses (greater than or equal to  g/day) of niacin.
Patients should be instructed to report promptly symptoms of muscle pain, weakness, or tenderness.
If such symptoms develop, creatine kinase should be measured, and if markedly elevated, lovastatin should be discontinued.
The value of routine monitoring of creatine kinase is not known.
In some studies up to  of patients experienced elevations in creatine kinase while on lovastatin.
In most cases these elevations were mild, transient, and not associated with clinical symptoms.

Dermatologic side effects associated with the administration of niacin have included flushing (facial and whole body) and pruritus.
Rare cases of hyperpigmentation and acanthosis nigricans have been reported.
Niacin-related flushing (facial and whole body) and pruritus occur as a result of stimulation and release of prostaglandins and have been major drawbacks of this drug.
These symptoms have occurred in up to  of patients and usually resolved after  weeks of continued therapy.
Flushing can be minimized with use of an extended release form of the drug, gradual dosage titration (over  to  months), and by administering the dosage during or within  minutes after meals.
Aspirin ( mg), if not otherwise contraindicated), taken within  minutes of niacin ingestion and avoidance of hot beverages and alcohol which can aggravate flushing by causing peripheral vasodilation may be recommended to reduce flushing.
Endocrine side effects of lovastatin have included hypospermia.
Other endocrine side effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have included gynecomastia and thyroid dysfunction.
Rare incidences of altered thyroid function tests associated with the use of niacin have been reported.
Changes appeared to be due to decreased thyroid binding capacity and concentration of thyroid binding globulin.
Gastrointestinal side effects associated with the administration of lovastatin have included flatulence (to ), abdominal pain (to ), diarrhea (to ), constipation (to ), nausea (to ), dyspepsia, and heartburn.

Persistent fatigue, nausea or anorexia may be a sign of hepatotoxicity.
Gastrointestinal side effects are among the most common complaints in patients on lovastatin.
These effects tend to be mild and transient in nature and will often dissipate with continued therapy.
Niacin has been shown to increase plasma homocysteine levels.
Homocysteine is an independent risk factor for arterial occlusive disease.
Clinical implications of these increases and the influence of folic acid supplementation as a means to decrease homocysteine levels remain to be determined.
Cardiovascular side effects associated with the administration of niacin generally have been rare and have included transient tachycardia, hypotension and dizziness.
The Coronary Drug Project  reported a significant increase in cardiac arrhythmias associated with the use of niacin; some experts consider preexisting arrhythmias or angina pectoris contraindications to its use.
Niacin have been shown to increase plasma homocysteine levels.
Homocysteine is an independent risk factor for arterial occlusive disease.
Clinical implications of these increases and the influence of folic acid supplementation as a means to decrease homocysteine levels remain to be determined.
Genitourinary side effects associated with the administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including lovastatin, have included erectile dysfunction.
Genitourinary side effects associated with the administration of niacin have included decreased sexual function in up to  and  of male patients who have taken unmodified and timed release niacin, respectively.
Halkin, et al report a case in which use of both lovastatin and pravastatin on different occasions in the same patient led to reversible impotence.
The impotence resolved within  weeks after discontinuation of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.
Hematologic side effects associated with the administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have included hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia.

Persistent elevations in liver function tests to three times normal values have been reported in up to  of patients on lovastatin in clinical trials.
Overall,  of patients were withdrawn from study due to elevations in serum transaminases.
While most patients remained asymptomatic with these elevations, cases of cholestatic jaundice and hepatitis have been reported.
Liver function tests should be closely monitored.
Lovastatin should be discontinued in patients with persistent, significant elevations (three times the upper limit of normal) in liver function parameters.
Hepatotoxicity has been reported in  to  of patients who have taken larger doses ( grams or more daily) of niacin or who have used timed release preparations.
Hepatotoxicity usually reverses within one week after drug discontinuation, but sometimes can be avoided with dosage reductions or switching to crystalline niacin (if hepatotoxicity  developed while using a timed release preparation).
Clinical monitoring of patient response and tolerance, including laboratory evaluation of liver function tests is generally recommended.
Dose-related increases in aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase have been associated with dosage increases greater than  grams over  month.
Computerized tomography has revealed changes consistent with focal fatty liver in some cases.
Although these changes usually resolve with dose reduction, continued routine monitoring of liver function tests is recommended.
