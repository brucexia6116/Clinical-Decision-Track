As well as its needed effects, mebendazole (the active ingredient contained in Vermox) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some mebendazole side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Since mebendazole (the active ingredient contained in Vermox) is not well absorbed, few systemic side effects are reported.
Side effects may be more likely and more severe in patients with underlying liver disease.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, especially when the intestinal parasite burden is great.
Increased liver function tests have been associated with mebendazole (the active ingredient contained in Vermox) in patients with hepatic hydatid cysts.
Hepatic side effects have included transient changes in liver function tests and granulomatous hepatitis.
These side effects have been reported when mebendazole was taken for prolonged periods and at dosages substantially above those recommended.
Bone marrow biopsy results during mebendazole-associated leukopenia or pancytopenia have revealed hypocellularity.
These effects reverse upon drug discontinuation.
Hematologic side effects are unusual and reversible, but may be severe.
Profound leukopenia, often accompanied by anemia and thrombocytopenia, has been reported.
Pancytopenia and neutropenia have also been reported.
Dermatologic side effects have included rare reports of alopecia and angioedema.
Rash, pruritus, urticaria, and flushing have also been reported.
No evidence of hypersensitivity (eosinophilia, rash, leukocytosis) accompanied the rare reports of drug fever.
The fever may have been idiosyncratic or evidence of a reaction to drug-induced tissue necrosis in hydatid cysts.
Other side effects have included chills and drug fever.
Nervous system side effects have been reported rarely.
These have included weakness, drowsiness, and seizures.
It is possible that some side effects of Vermox may not have been reported.
These can be reported to the FDA here.
Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
