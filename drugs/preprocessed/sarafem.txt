Common side effects of Sarafem include: anxiety, asthenia, diarrhea, drowsiness, dyspepsia, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, tremor, headache, anorexia, decreased libido, xerostomia, and decreased appetite.
Other side effects include: dizziness, skin rash, and diaphoresis.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, fluoxetine (the active ingredient contained in Sarafem) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking fluoxetine, check with your doctor immediately:
Some fluoxetine side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most common side effects that have been associated with the discontinuation of placebo-controlled clinical trials were anxiety, nervousness, nausea, rash, pruritus, insomnia, asthenia, and headache.
The side effect profile appears generally similar between adults, children, and adolescents.
Treatment-emergent side effects reported in pediatric patients that were reported at an incidence of at least  or more for fluoxetine (the active ingredient contained in Sarafem) and greater than placebo included thirst, hyperkinesia, agitation, personality disorder, epistaxis, urinary frequency, and menorrhagia.
The most common side effect associated with treatment discontinuation in children and adolescents was mania/hypomania.
Antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.
An increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged  to  years) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders has been reported with short-term use of antidepressant drugs.
Adult and pediatric patients receiving antidepressants for MDD, as well as for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric indications, have reported symptoms that may be precursors to emerging suicidality, including anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania.
Causality has not been established.

One retrospective study of  outpatients with Parkinson's disease treated with  mg of fluoxetine a day reported that three patients experienced worsening of parkinsonism, two patients experienced improvement of parkinsonism, and  patients experienced no change.
Another small study reported a series of four patients who experienced worsening of parkinsonism during treatment with fluoxetine.
Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs as monotherapy, but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs and drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin.
A number of case reports have implicated fluoxetine in causing seizures.
Twelve of  patients experienced convulsions during pre-marketing testing.
A case of dose-dependent exacerbation of preexisting, mild restless legs syndrome (which ultimately required discontinuation of fluoxetine) has been reported.
One placebo-controlled study has suggested that fluoxetine (the active ingredient contained in Sarafem) has no effects on intraventricular conduction.
Other case reports have suggested that fluoxetine may rarely provoke dysrhythmias.
Other conflicting case reports have suggested that fluoxetine may have a propensity to provoke and alleviate vasoconstriction.
Several cases of unexpected death occurring shortly after initiation of fluoxetine therapy have been reported in elderly patients with multiple medical problems.
In one case report, QTc prolongation and torsades de pointes developed in an elderly woman  months after starting therapy with fluoxetine  mg daily.
The QTc interval returned to normal following discontinuation of fluoxetine.
Four additional cases suggesting fluoxetine associated QTc prolongation or torsades de pointes have been reported.
Common ( to ): Chest pain, flushing, hypertension, palpitations, vasodilatationUncommon ( to ): Angina pectoris, arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, generalized edema, hypotension, myocardial infarct, peripheral edema, postural hypotensionRare (less than ): Bradycardia, extrasystoles, heart block, pallor, peripheral vascular disorder, phlebitis, shock, thrombophlebitis, thrombosis, vasculitis, vasospasm, ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular fibrillationPostmarketing reports: Atrial fibrillation, heart arrest, QT-interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes
A study of , antidepressant users has reported  times more upper GI bleeding episodes with the use of SSRIs relative to the population who did not receive antidepressant medications.

Numerous cases of hyponatremia have been reported following treatment with an SSRI.
Risk factors for the development of SSRI associated hyponatremia including advanced age, female gender, concomitant use of diuretics, low body weight, and lower baseline serum sodium levels have been identified.
Hyponatremia tends to develop within the first few weeks of treatment (range  to  days) and typically resolves within  weeks (range  hours to  weeks) after therapy has been discontinued with some patients requiring treatment.
The proposed mechanism for the development of hyponatremia involves the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) via release of antidiuretic hormone.
Decreased weight gain has been observed in association with the use of fluoxetine (the active ingredient contained in Sarafem) in children and adolescent patients.
Very common ( or more): AnorexiaCommon ( to ): Weight loss Uncommon ( to ): Decreased appetite, dehydration, gout, hypocholesteremia, hyperlipemia, hypokalemia Rare (less than ): Alcohol intolerance, creatine phosphokinase increased, diabetes mellitus, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremiaPostmarketing reports: Hypoglycemia

Urinary retention and galactorrhea have been reported with other SSRIs.
The estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance may underestimate their actual incidence, partly because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss this issue.
In placebo-controlled clinical trials ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculation delay) was reported as a treatment-emergent side effect at an incidence of  and at least twice the incidence in placebo-treated male patients.
