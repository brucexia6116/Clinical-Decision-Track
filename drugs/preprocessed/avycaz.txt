In a phase  cIAI trial, death occurred in  of patients using this drug with metronidazole and  of patients using meropenem.
In a subgroup of patients with baseline CrCl  to  mL/min, death occurred in  of  patients using this drug with metronidazole and  of  patients using meropenem; patients using this drug received a  lower daily dose than is currently recommended for this patient population.
In patients with baseline CrCl greater than  mL/min, death occurred in  of  patients using this drug with metronidazole and  of  patients using meropenem.
