Check with your doctor if any of these most COMMON side effects persist or become bothersome:
Headache; loss of appetite; nausea; nervousness; tremors; trouble sleeping.
Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); chest pain; fast heartbeat; wheezing.
Cardiovascular side effects have included elevations of heart rate and blood pressure.
In smaller doses, racepinephrine has caused peripheral coronary arterial vasodilation, but in larger doses, racepinephrine has caused diffuse vasoconstriction.
This has caused increased peripheral vascular resistance, which was important in patients with coronary artery disease (worsened myocardial ischemia/angina) or hypertension (risk of emergent hypertension/stroke).
Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have been reported in patients with underlying cardiac disease.
Rapid rises in blood pressure have produced cerebral hemorrhage, particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease.
Angina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease.
Gastrointestinal side effects have included nausea and vomiting.
Nervous system side effects have included fear, agitation, anxiety, tenseness, restlessness, headache, tremor, dizziness, lightheadedness, nervousness, sleeplessness, excitability, weakness, and increased parkinsonian tremors.
Psychiatric side effects have included agitation, disorientation, impaired memory, aggressive or assautive behavior, hallucinations, and psychosis.
It is possible that some side effects of racepinephrine may not have been reported.
These can be reported to the FDA here.
Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
