If any of the following symptoms of overdose occur while taking duloxetine, get emergency help immediately:
The most commonly reported side effects reported in placebo-controlled clinical trials included nausea, dry mouth, somnolence, constipation, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, agitation, fatigue, insomnia, dizzinessThe most commonly reported side effects reported in placebo-controlled clinical trials as a reason for treatment discontinuation and considered to be drug-related included nausea, dizziness, somnolence, headache, and fatigue.
Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between the use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SSRIs and SNRIs, including duloxetine as monotherapy, but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs and drugs that impair the metabolism of serotonin.
Antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment.
An increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults (aged  to  years) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders has been reported with short-term use of antidepressant drugs.
Adult and pediatric patients receiving antidepressants for MDD, as well as for psychiatric and nonpsychiatric indications, have reported symptoms that may be precursors to emerging suicidality, including anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania.
Causality has not been established.
Aggression and anger have been reported particularly early in treatment or after treatment discontinuation.
Very common ( or more): InsomniaCommon ( to ): Abnormal dreams, agitation, anxiety, sleep disorderUncommon ( to ): Apathy, bruxism, disorientation/confusional state, irritability, mood swings, nervousness, poor quality sleep, suicide attemptRare (less than ): Aggression and anger, completed suicide, hallucinations, mania, suicidal behavior and ideation
Common ( to ): Decreased appetite, weight increase/decreaseUncommon ( to ): Dehydration, hyperlipidemia, hyponatremia, increased blood cholesterol, increased blood creatine phosphokinaseRare (less than ): Dyslipidemia, increased blood potassiumFrequency not reported: Abnormal potassium levels, increased bicarbonatePostmarketing reports: Hyperglycemia
Although infrequent, several cases of duloxetine induced hyponatremia have been reported.
In one case report, duloxetine induced hyponatremia was confirmed after inadvertent rechallenge.
It has been suggested that there is a dose-related effect in the development of hyponatremia with duloxetine.
Numerous cases of hyponatremia have been reported following treatment with an SSRI.
Risk factors include advanced age, female gender, concomitant use of diuretics, low body weight, and lower baseline serum sodium levels.
Hyponatremia tends to develop within the first few weeks of treatment (range  to  days) and typically resolves within  weeks (range  hours to  weeks) after therapy has been discontinued with some patients requiring treatment (, water restriction, dietary sodium).
The proposed mechanism for the development of hyponatremia involves the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) via release of antidiuretic hormone.
Falls were reported more commonly in patients  years of age or older.
Very common ( or more): FatigueCommon ( to ): Asthenia, chills/rigors, pyrexia, vertigoUncommon ( to ): Ear pain, falls, feeling abnormal, feeling hot and/or cold, malaise, thirst, tinnitus
Orthostatic hypotension and syncope tend to occur within the first week of therapy; however, they may occur at any time during treatment, particularly after dose increases.
The risk of blood pressure decreases may be greater when duloxetine is given concomitantly with drugs that may induce orthostatic hypotension, such as antihypertensives, with potent CYP A inhibitors, or with duloxetine doses above  mg per day.
Common ( to ): Flushing, hot flush, hypertension, increased blood pressure, palpitationsUncommon ( to ): Chest pain, myocardial infarction, orthostatic hypotension, peripheral coldness, tachycardiaRare (less than ): Hypertensive crisis, supraventricular arrhythmia (mainly atrial fibrillation)Postmarketing reports: Hematomas, ventricular arrhythmias
The reporting rate of Stevens-Johnson syndrome associated with duloxetine exceeds the general population background incidence rate ( to  cases per million person years).
Common ( to ): Pruritus, hyperhidrosisUncommon ( to ): Cold sweat, contact dermatitis, erythema, increased tendency to bruise, night sweats, photosensitivity reaction, urticariaRare (less than ): Angioneurotic edema, ecchymosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome Postmarketing reports: Erythema multiforme, petechiae, cutaneous vasculitis (sometimes with systemic involvement)
Uncommon ( to ): Hypothyroidism, syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)Postmarketing reports: Hyperprolactinemia
The Arizona sexual experience scale, used to identify sexual side effects, was used prospectively in  major depressive disorder placebo-controlled trials showed that male patients treated with duloxetine experienced significantly more sexual dysfunction than patients treated with placebo.
Common ( to ): Abnormal orgasm/anorgasmia, decreased libido, delayed ejaculation, ejaculation disorder, erectile dysfunction, urinary frequencyUncommon ( to ): Abnormal urine odor, dysuria, gynecological hemorrhage, menopausal symptoms, micturition urgency, nocturia, pollakiuria, polyuria, sexual dysfunction, testicular pain, urinary hesitationRare (less than ): Decreased urine flow, galactorrhea, menstrual disorder, urinary retention
Concomitant use of aspirin, NSAIDs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding events associated with duloxetine.
Postmarketing reports: Life-threatening hemorrhage, blood dyscrasias
Cases of liver failure, including fatalities, have been reported.
The majority of cases were reported in patients with past or current risk factors for liver injury, including alcohol abuse, hepatitis, or exposure to drugs with known adverse effects on the liver.
