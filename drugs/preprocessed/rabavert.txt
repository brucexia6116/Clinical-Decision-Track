Get emergency medical help if you have signs of an allergic reaction:  hives; difficult breathing; swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
You should not receive a booster vaccine if you had a life-threatening allergic reaction after the first shot.

Keep track of any and all side effects you have after receiving this vaccine.
When you receive a booster dose, you will need to tell the doctor if the previous shot caused any side effects.
Becoming infected with rabies is much more dangerous to your health than receiving this vaccine.
However, like any medicine, this vaccine can cause side effects but the risk of serious side effects is extremely low.
Call your doctor at once if you have rare but serious side effects, such as:
a very high fever;
tingling or a prickly feeling in your fingers or toes; 
weakness or unusual feeling in your arms and legs; or
problems with balance or eye movement, trouble speaking or swallowing.
Common side effects may include:
pain, redness, or a hard lump where the shot was given;
fever, flu symptoms, swollen glands, weakness, general ill feeling;
headache, feeling tired;
dizziness;
muscle or joint pain; 
nausea; or
skin rash.
This is not a complete list of side effects and others may occur.

Nervous system side effects have included dizziness, transient paresthesias, neuroparalysis, encephalitis, meningitis, transient paralysis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myelitis, retrobulbar neuritis, multiple sclerosis, vertigo, and visual disturbance.
The use of corticosteroids to treat life-threatening neuroparalytic reactions may inhibit the development of immunity to rabies.

The risk of developing a potentially fatal rabies infection should be considered before making the decision to discontinue rabies vaccination when severe anaphylactic or neuroparalytic reactions occur.
The State Health Department or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be consulted for advice on managing serious reactions.
Adverse reactions should be reported to the U.
S.
Department of Health and Human Services Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
