Along with their needed effects, medicines like thioguanine can sometimes cause unwanted effects such as blood problems and other side effects.
These and others are described below.
Also, because of the way these medicines act on the body, there is a chance that they might cause other unwanted effects that may not occur until months or years after the medicine is used.
These delayed effects may include certain types of cancer, such as leukemia.
Discuss these possible effects with your doctor.
Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking thioguanine, check with your doctor immediately:
If any of the following side effects occur while taking thioguanine, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
Some thioguanine side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
After you stop taking this drug, it is possible that you may still experience side effects that need medical attention.
If you notice any of the following side effects check with your doctor immediately:
Because thioguanine may have delayed effect, the drug should be withdrawn temporarily at the first sign of an abnormally large fall in any of the formed elements of the blood.
Hyperuricemia can be minimized by increased hydration, urine alkalinization, and the prophylactic administration of a xanthine oxidase inhibitor such as allopurinol.
Hematologic side effects including myelosuppression have been reported.
Myelosuppression is the most frequent adverse reaction to thioguanine and may appear as anemia, leukopenia, and/or thrombocytopenia.
The induction of complete remission of acute myelogenous leukemia usually requires combination chemotherapy in dosages which produce marrow hypoplasia.
Since consolidation and maintenance of remission are also affected by multiple drug regimens whose component agents cause myelosuppression, pancytopenia is observed in nearly all patients.
Hyperuricemia frequently occurs in patients receiving thioguanine as a consequence of rapid cell lysis accompanying the antineoplastic effect.
Life-threatening infection and bleeding have been observed as consequences of thioguanine-induced granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia.
Gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and stomatitis have been reported.
Intestinal necrosis and perforation have been reported in patients who received multiple drug chemotherapy which included thioguanine.
If severe diarrhea and/or stomatitis develop, a decrease in dosage may be appropriate.
Hepatic side effects including veno-occlusive liver disease have been reported.
A case of peliosis hepatitis has been reported.
Liver enzyme and other liver function studies are occasionally abnormal.
If jaundice, hepatomegaly, or anorexia with tenderness in the right hypochondrium occurs, thioguanine should be withheld until the exact etiology can be determined.
Respiratory side effects including esophageal varices have been reported in patients receiving continuous busulfan and thioguanine therapy.
Nasal congestion and rhinorrhea have been reported with high dose IV therapy.
Renal side effects including nephrotoxicity have been reported in high-dose therapy.
Dermatologic side effects including the development of painful erythematous swelling of the palms and soles occurring several days after courses of therapy, have been reported in  women on cytarabine, doxorubicin, and thioguanine.
Alopecia has also been reported.
Other side effects including malaise, lethargy, weakness, ataxia, and loss of vibratory sensation have been reported.
Cardiovascular side effects have been reported.
In one study, two of thirteen patients administered  mg/m intravenously developed bradycardia and nonspecific T-wave flattening, which resolved within  hours.
In another study, five of nineteen patients administered  mg/m intravenously demonstrated minor changes:  bradycardia (two patients), nonspecific ST- and T-wave changes (five), and P-wave changes (one).
It is possible that some side effects of thioguanine may not have been reported.
These can be reported to the FDA here.
