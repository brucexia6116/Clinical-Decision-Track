If any of the following side effects occur while taking amifostine, check with your doctor or nurse immediately:
Cardiovascular side effects include a transient reduction in blood pressure in 62% of patients.
Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation/flutter and supraventricular tachycardia have been reported.
(These have sometimes been associated with hypotension or allergic reactions.
)  Transient hypertension and exacerbations of preexisting hypertension, and short term, reversible loss of consciousness have been reported rarely.
The mean time of onset until reduction in blood pressure was 14 minutes into the 15 minute amifostine infusion.
The mean duration was six minutes.
Blood pressure generally returned to normal within five to fifteen minutes.
In order to avoid hypotension, amifostine has sometimes been administered by the subcutaneous route.
Gastrointestinal side effects frequently include nausea and/or vomiting which may be severe.
These effects have not generally precluded the completion of therapy.
Other side effects include flushing/feeling of warmth, fever, malaise, chills/feeling of coldness, dizziness, somnolence, hiccups, syncope, and sneezing.
In case of an acute allergic reaction, amifostine should be immediately and permanently discontinued.
Epinephrine and other measures should be available for the treatment of serious allergic events such as anaphylaxis.
Hypersensitivity side effects have included hypotension, fever, chills/rigors, dyspnea, skin rashes, and urticaria.
Anaphylactoid reactions including hypoxia, laryngeal edema, and chest tightness have also been reported.
Anaphylactoid reactions associated with cardiac arrest have been reported rarely.
A case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome has also been reported.
Cutaneous eruptions have been commonly reported during clinical trials and were generally not serious.
Dermatologic side effects include skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, erythema multiforme, and rarely Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Nervous system side effects rarely include seizures.
Musculoskeletal side effects including a case of amifostine-induced back pain have been reported.
Metabolic side effects including hypocalcemia (up to 1%) have been reported.
