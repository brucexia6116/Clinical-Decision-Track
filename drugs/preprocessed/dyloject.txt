NSAIDs including this drug, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) events which can occur at any time, with or without warning.
For patients who develop a serious upper GI event, only about  were symptomatic.
Upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation occurred in approximately  of patients treated with NSAIDs for  to  months and  to  of patients treated for  year.
Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding had a greater than -fold increased risk for developing a GI bleed than patients with neither of these risk factors.
Borderline elevations of  or more liver tests to less than  times the upper limit of the normal ( x ULN) or greater elevations in transaminases occurred in about  of patients treated with this drug.
Elevations to greater than  x ULN of AST occurred in about  (n=) of patients at some point during treatment.
In an open-labeled trial among patients receiving NSAIDs, a higher incidence of transaminase elevations were observed in patients receiving diclofenac (the active ingredient contained in Dyloject) compared with other NSAIDs.

NSAIDs inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients.
Unlike aspirin, the NSAID effect on platelet function is quantitatively less, of shorter duration, and reversible.

Clinical trials of several cyclooxygenase (COX)- selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to  years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.
All NSAIDs appear to have a similar risk.
There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates this increased risk and may be associated with an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal events.
Pharmacoepidemiological data reveal an increased risk of arteriothrombotic events associated with diclofenac (the active ingredient contained in Dyloject) use, particularly at a high dose and during long-term treatment.
In a meta-analysis of long-term treatment with diclofenac  mg/day, compared with placebo use of this drug resulted in approximately  additional major vascular events per  participants.
