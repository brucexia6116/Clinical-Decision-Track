The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment and is associated with the presence of Clostridium difficile toxin in the stool.
Pseudomembranous colitis may also be associated with toxic megacolon, which can be life-threatening.
An unpleasant or metallic taste has occasionally been reported after high doses of IV clindamycin (the active ingredient contained in Cleocin Pediatric) 
Common ( to ): Pseudomembranous colitis, diarrhea, abdominal painUncommon ( to ): Dysgeusia, nausea, vomitingFrequency not reported: Esophageal ulcers, esophagitis (oral preparations)
Common ( to ): Maculopapular rashUncommon ( to ): UrticariaRare (less than ): Erythema multiforme, pruritusFrequency not reported: Toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, exfoliative dermatitis, bullous dermatitis, generalized mild to moderate morbilliform-like rash, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), Sweet's SyndromePostmarketing reports: Serious cutaneous adverse reaction
Rash was particularly common in AIDS patients.
A -year-old female patient with multiple comorbidities was diagnosed with Sweet's Syndrome.
The patient's symptoms developed  days after initiating oral clindamycin therapy for a tooth infection.
The patient's symptoms persisted despite tooth extraction and continuance of antibiotic treatment with intravenous, then oral, clindamycin.
Following discontinuation of clindamycin, the patient's symptoms resolved over several days.
Drug-induced Sweet's syndrome was determined based on the temporal relationship of the patient's symptoms, the beginning and end of clindamycin therapy, and the exclusion of other etiologies.
Three days after starting oral clindamycin for the persistence of symptoms following a root canal, a -year-old male patient reported "pimples" on his scalp which changed to pustules  hours later.
The lesions progressed and the patient's antibiotic therapy was discontinued.
Two days later, the rash improved considerably.
The patient met the diagnostic criteria for drug-induced Sweet's syndrome and clindamycin was the most likely cause due to the timeline of antibiotic therapy and the patient's improvement following its discontinuation.
