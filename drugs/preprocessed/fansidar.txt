Hypersensitivity reactions have included erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, generalized skin eruptions, toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria, serum sickness, pruritus, exfoliative dermatitis, anaphylactoid reactions, periorbital edema, conjunctival and scleral injection, photosensitization, arthralgia, and allergic pericarditis.
Fatalities due to severe hypersensitivity reactions have been reported.
Severe cutaneous reactions have occurred in patients who have taken as few as two doses of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine.
The risk of fatal cutaneous reactions in patients receiving pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine has been estimated to range from  in , to  in ,  In general, the use of sulfonamide antibiotics is associated with large increases in the risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, although these phenomena are rare as a whole.
Dermatologic side effects have frequently included phototoxicity, rash, dermatitis, and hair loss.
Hematologic toxicity is more common with higher doses of pyrimethamine.
Many cases of agranulocytosis have occurred during therapy with pyrimethamine-dapsone, although it has been reported in patients receiving pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine as well.

Granulomas and necrosis have been seen on biopsy.
Renal side effects have included renal failure, interstitial nephritis, toxic nephrosis with oliguria and anuria, crystalluria, and increases in BUN and serum creatinine.
Respiratory side effects have included cough , pulmonary infiltrates and shortness of breath which may be due to pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions.

Metabolic side effects associated with sulfonamides have included diuresis and hypoglycemia.
Sulfonamides are chemically similar to goitrogenic agents (i.
e.
, diuretics and oral hypoglycemic agents).
Genitourinary side effects have included crystalluria.
Endocrine side effects including weight gain ( kg or greater) have been reported in  of patients.
