See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
Other dosage forms:
As well as its needed effects, voriconazole may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking voriconazole, check with your doctor immediately:
Some voriconazole side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most frequently reported side effects in clinical trials were visual disturbances, fever/pyrexia, nausea, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, headache, increased/abnormal liver function test, peripheral edema, respiratory distress, abdominal pain, tachycardia, and hallucinations.
Side effects that most frequently led to the discontinuation of voriconazole treatment included visual disturbances, rash, and elevated liver function tests.
Very common ( or more): Abnormal vision (up to ), visual disturbances/impairment (including altered/enhanced visual perception, blurred vision, chromatopsia, color vision change, photophobia)Common ( to ): Photophobia, chromatopsia, retinal hemorrhageUncommon ( to ): Papilledema, optic nerve disorder, optic neuritis, scleritis, blepharitis, diplopia, oculogyric crisis/oculogyrationRare (less than ): Optic atrophy, corneal opacityFrequency not reported: Eye hemorrhage, abnormality of accommodation, color blindness, conjunctivitis, eye pain, dry eyes, keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, mydriasis, night blindness, retinitis, uveitis, visual field defect, transient altered perception of light, blurred vision, wavy lines on television or on going to sleepPostmarketing reports: Prolonged visual adverse events (including optic neuritis and papilledema)
The visual disturbances were usually mild and rarely resulted in the discontinuation of therapy.
Ocular side effects have been reported frequently and have included abnormal vision, altered/enhanced visual perception, blurred vision, color vision change, and/or photophobia in about  of patients.
These visual disturbances were transient and fully reversible; most spontaneously resolving within  hour with no clinically significant long-term visual effects.
Attenuation was observed with repeated doses.
Visual disturbances may be related to higher plasma voriconazole levels and/or doses.
The mechanism has not been fully identified; however, the site of action is most likely within the retina.
In a -day study of the effect of voriconazole on retinal activity in healthy subjects, alterations in color perception, decreases in electroretinogram waveform amplitude, and diminished visual field measurements were linked to the administration of voriconazole.
Within  days of stopping the drug, each indicator of visual function had returned to baseline.
Elevated alkaline phosphatase (greater than  times ULN; up to ) and decreased potassium (less than  times lower limit of normal; up to ) have been reported.
Very common ( or more): Elevated alkaline phosphatase (up to ), decreased potassium (up to )Common ( to ): Hypokalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremiaUncommon ( to ): Increased blood cholesterol, hypercholesterolemia, hypomagnesemiaFrequency not reported: Decreased glucose tolerance, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypernatremia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, anorexia, hyperinsulinemia

The overall incidence of clinically significant transaminase abnormalities during clinical studies was  of patients treated with voriconazole.
Increased incidence of abnormal liver function tests may be related to higher plasma levels and/or doses.
Most abnormal liver function tests resolved during therapy without dose adjustment or after dose adjustment (including therapy discontinuation).

Most rashes were of mild to moderate severity.
A photosensitivity reaction (manifested as facial edema and cheilitis) was reported in ambulatory patients (n=) receiving voriconazole  mg twice daily for chronic invasive Aspergillus  weeks after starting therapy.
Symptoms resolved shortly after stopping the drug.
Plasma and serum levels of all-trans retinol and -cis retinol were elevated in all the cases (n=) measured supporting a hypothesis that voriconazole inhibits a step in the breakdown of all-trans retinoic acid.
A -year-old patient experienced pseudoporphyria after minimal sun exposure coincident with voriconazole therapy.
After pseudoporphyria was diagnosed and because the drug could not be stopped, the patient was instructed to avoid the sun and use sunscreens with UVA and UVB protection.
The drug was stopped after a year of therapy, but the patient continued to be extremely photosensitive for several months.
A -year-old female with a history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma  years post allogeneic bone marrow transplant experienced blistering eruptions coincident with voriconazole therapy.
Her posttransplant course had been complicated by chronic, grade , cutaneous graft versus host disease requiring therapy.
The patient had no history of bullous skin lesions.
She was started on voriconazole  mg twice daily as prophylactic antifungal therapy.
One week later, tense blisters were observed on the hips and later on the hands.
There were prodromal burning sensations, but no associated pruritus or pain.
The lesions resolved over  to  days without scarring.
She experienced recurrent episodes involving her legs and feet.
A biopsy obtained from the knee showed moderate hyperkeratosis, striking atrophy, and extensive basal vacuolization and colloid body formation.
The temporal association of voriconazole initiation and onset of the eruption raised suspicion that it was the etiologic factor; thus, the drug was discontinued.
The blistering resolved within  weeks with no further episodes.
