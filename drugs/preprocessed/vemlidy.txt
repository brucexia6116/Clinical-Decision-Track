Rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, muscular weakness, and myopathy may occur as a result of proximal renal tubulopathy.
Rhabdomyolysis, muscular weakness, and myopathy have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Death due to progression of liver disease has been reported in  of patients with chronic HBV and decompensated liver disease (n=).
On-treatment ALT or hepatic flares have been reported in patients with chronic HBV.
In general, ALT flares occurred within the first  to  weeks of therapy, accompanied by decreases in HBV-DNA levels, and resolved within  to  weeks without changes to therapy.
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in patients with hepatitis B after discontinuation of this drug.
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (including fatal cases) have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs.
Hepatic steatosis and hepatitis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Common ( to ): Elevated transaminases, elevated ALT, elevated AST, death due to progression of liver diseaseRare ( to ): Hepatic steatosis, hepatitisFrequency not reported: On-treatment ALT or hepatic flares, lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis (including fatal cases), severe acute exacerbations of hepatitisPostmarketing reports: Elevated liver enzymes (primarily AST, ALT, gamma glutamyltransferase)
A confirmed increase in serum creatinine of  mg/dL was reported in  of patients with chronic HBV and decompensated liver disease (n=); however, since tenofovir and decompensated liver disease may have an impact on renal function, the contribution of tenofovir to renal impairment in these patients is difficult to ascertain.
Proximal renal tubulopathy generally resolved or improved after this drug was stopped; however, decreased CrCl did not completely resolve in some patients after stopping tenofovir DF.
Rhabdomyolysis, osteomalacia, bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures), hypokalemia, muscular weakness, myopathy, and hypophosphatemia may occur as a result of proximal renal tubulopathy.
