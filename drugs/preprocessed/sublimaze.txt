Cases of seizures have occasionally been reported, but some investigators have suggested that the seizure-like events reported may have been episodes of fentanyl induced-rigidity.
One report has suggested that epidural fentanyl (the active ingredient contained in Sublimaze) may mask the pain of myocardial ischemia in patients treated with fentanyl for other reasons.
Another report has suggested that QTc interval prolongation may occur in some patients receiving the related narcotic sufentanil.
Another report has implicated fentanyl as a potential cause of pulsus alternans in a patient with aortic stenosis and congestive heart failure.
Nevertheless, fentanyl has been advocated by some as a satisfactory agent for coronary artery surgery.

Approximately 60% of patients had some redness at the skin site 24-hours after removal of the iontophoretic transdermal system.

Rare (less than 0.
1%): Anaphylaxis
The hemolysis observed may have been related to rapid injection of large volumes of hypotonic fentanyl (the active ingredient contained in Sublimaze) solution.
The authors therefore recommend slower injection rates and/or mixture in isotonic fluid.
