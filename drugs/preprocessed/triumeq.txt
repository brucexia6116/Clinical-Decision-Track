As well as its needed effects, abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine, check with your doctor immediately:
Some abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most common side effects were insomnia, headache, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness.
Many of the side effects listed occurred commonly in patients with abacavir hypersensitivity (, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, lethargy, rash).
Hypersensitivity reactions were reported with abacavir and dolutegravir and shared some common features (, fever and/or rash with other symptoms that indicated multi-organ involvement).
In general, time to onset was  to  days for both abacavir- and dolutegravir-associated reactions.
Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with abacavir.
Such reactions have included multi-organ failure and anaphylaxis and usually occurred within the first  weeks of abacavir therapy; however, abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have occurred any time during therapy.
Patients with the human leukocyte antigen subtype B* (HLA-B*) allele are at higher risk of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions; however, such reactions have occurred in patients without the HLA-B* allele.
Abacavir hypersensitivity was reported in about  of patients in  clinical trials with abacavir-containing products where patients were not screened for the HLA-B* allele; incidence of suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions was  in clinical trials where HLA-B* carriers were excluded.
Abacavir hypersensitivity reactions have been characterized by at least  of the following key signs/symptoms:  fever;  rash;  gastrointestinal symptoms (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain);  constitutional symptoms (including generalized malaise, fatigue, achiness);  respiratory symptoms (including dyspnea, cough, pharyngitis).
Almost all reactions have included fever and/or rash (usually maculopapular or urticarial); however, reactions also reported without fever or rash.
Signs/symptoms reported in at least  of patients with hypersensitivity reaction have included rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, fatigue/lethargy, malaise, headache, elevated liver function tests, and myalgia.
Other signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity have included mouth ulceration, sore throat, adult respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, edema, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, conjunctivitis, anaphylaxis, paresthesia, lymphopenia, hepatitis, liver failure, myolysis, arthralgia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, elevated creatinine, renal failure, abnormal chest x-ray findings (mainly infiltrates, which were localized), and death.
Symptoms of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction worsened with continued therapy and generally resolved when abacavir was discontinued.
Restarting abacavir after a hypersensitivity reaction has resulted in more severe symptoms within hours and included life-threatening hypotension and death.
Rarely, life-threatening reactions have occurred within hours after restarting abacavir in patients who stopped it for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity (or who stopped it with only  key symptom of hypersensitivity).
