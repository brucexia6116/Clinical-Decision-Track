Nervous system side effects, upon rapid injection, have included tingling sensations, a calcium taste, or a sense of oppression or "heat wave.
"
Local side effects have included phlebitis, a "burning" sensation and calcinosis cutis at the site of intravenous administration.
Calcification of veins has been rarely reported.
A slow infusion rate through a small bore needle into a large vein may minimize this venous irritation.
During ischemia, myocardial cells lose their ability to pump intracellular calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and out of the cell during diastole.
Sustained increases in the intracellular calcium concentration lead to pathological intracellular changes that may result in reduced myocardial systolic and diastolic function.
Calcium may reduce myocardial oxygen supply by causing coronary artery vasoconstriction or spasm or by increasing ventricular contractility and work.
The American Heart Association no longer recommends the routine use of calcium chloride during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
While many of the cardiovascular effects of injection can be expected, some may be anticipated and prevented.
Injections can be accompanied by peripheral vasodilatation as well as a local "burning" sensation.
Injections that are too rapid may produce hypotension and/or syncope.
Rare complications following infusion include the development of vasospastic angina, serious cardiac arrhythmias, AV dissociation, or shock.
Some of these side effects have occurred in patients who were digitalized.
Extreme caution is advised when administering to a patient who has received digitalis since calcium may unmask digitalis intoxication.
Cardiovascular side effects have included peripheral vasodilation, hypotension, and syncope.
Vasospastic angina, serious cardiac arrhythmias, AV dissociation, and shock have been reported rarely.
Administration to digitalized patients may unmask digitalis intoxication.
