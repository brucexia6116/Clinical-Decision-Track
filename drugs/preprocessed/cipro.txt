, as when used to treat or prevent travelers' diarrhea).
A 27-year-old woman with mild systemic erythematosus developed toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) after starting a second oral course of this drug after a prior 5-day course.
She developed a rash, high fever, and diarrhea after taking the 2nd dose and presented with diffuse rash, epidermal sloughing of 60% of the skin, desquamation of the lips, shock, and respiratory distress.
She died on the 28th hospital day of TEN, right ventricular failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
As of 2003, 9 cases of TEN, including 5 fatalities, had been reported in the literature.
Erythema nodosum, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (potentially life-threatening), and TEN (potentially life-threatening) have also been reported during postmarketing experience.

Seizures have been reported in 2 patients given this drug and foscarnet.
The temporal association between the onset of seizures and drug administration suggests a possible drug interaction; causal relationship was not established in either case.
Both drugs are individually epileptogenic; concurrent use may potentiate risk of seizures.
Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy (affecting small and/or large axons) resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness have been reported.
One survey reported 11 cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with this drug.

Arthropathy has primarily been a concern in pediatric patients; however, at least 1 case was described in an adult cystic fibrosis patient receiving this drug.
Although cystic fibrosis arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy typically occur in 7% to 8% of cystic fibrosis adults and adolescents, the arthropathy exhibited in this patient did not resemble either.
Several elements in its presentation strongly supported the diagnosis of ciprofloxacin-induced arthropathy, such as: a consistent time of onset with other reported cases of suspected quinolone-induced arthropathy (usually 3 weeks after starting therapy); a lack of history of arthralgia in the patient; reoccurrence upon rechallenge; and resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of therapy (usually 2 weeks after therapy stopped).
Tendinitis with subsequent tendon rupture has been documented in numerous case reports.
One patient with chronic renal failure developed bilateral Achilles tendon rupture after 4 days of ciprofloxacin therapy.
Although renal transplant patients and those with end-stage renal disease tend to have an increased risk of Achilles tendinitis and rupture over the general population, quinolone use has been shown to further increase that risk (12% in quinolone-treated patients versus 7% in nonquinolone-treated patients).
As of October 1994, 25 cases of Achilles tendon rupture had been reported to the US FDA.
Some ruptures have also occurred in the hand or shoulder.
Other risk factors identified included age and corticosteroid use.
There had been 23 reports of tendinitis submitted to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Committee (ADRAC) between 2006 and 2008, including reports of Achilles tendinitis, tendon rupture, and tendon pain and swelling.
The reports were primarily in male patients (15 cases) older than 56 years who used this drug for 2 to 14 days.
In 19 of the reported cases, a fluoroquinolone (generally ciprofloxacin) was the primary suspect; however, details of concomitant serious medical conditions were not documented in most of the reports.
Musculoskeletal side effects reported in pediatric patients included arthralgia, abnormal gait, abnormal joint exam, joint sprains, leg pain, back pain, arthrosis, bone pain, pain, myalgia, arm pain, and decreased range of motion in a joint (knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, shoulder).
Myalgia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
