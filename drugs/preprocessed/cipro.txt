Common side effects of Cipro include: arthralgia.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
The most common side effects (from clinical trials of all formulations, doses, durations of therapy, and indications) were nausea, diarrhea, abnormal liver function tests, vomiting, and rash.
The most common side effects reported with the IV formulation were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, injection and infusion site reactions, rash, and increased transaminases (transient).
Antibiotic-associated colitis with possible fatal outcome was reported very rarely.
The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms has been reported during or after antimicrobial treatment.

Photosensitivity was seen most often when patients were exposed to intense sun (, as when used to treat or prevent travelers' diarrhea).
A -year-old woman with mild systemic erythematosus developed toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) after starting a second oral course of this drug after a prior -day course.
She developed a rash, high fever, and diarrhea after taking the nd dose and presented with diffuse rash, epidermal sloughing of  of the skin, desquamation of the lips, shock, and respiratory distress.
She died on the th hospital day of TEN, right ventricular failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
As of ,  cases of TEN, including  fatalities, had been reported in the literature.
Erythema nodosum, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (potentially life-threatening), and TEN (potentially life-threatening) have also been reported during postmarketing experience.

Seizures have been reported in  patients given this drug and foscarnet.
The temporal association between the onset of seizures and drug administration suggests a possible drug interaction; causal relationship was not established in either case.
Both drugs are individually epileptogenic; concurrent use may potentiate risk of seizures.
Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy (affecting small and/or large axons) resulting in paresthesias, hypoesthesias, dysesthesias, and weakness have been reported.
One survey reported  cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with this drug.
The severity ranged from mild and reversible to severe and persistent.
In  case, a -year-old female developed numbness, allodynia, hypoesthesia, tremors, electrical and diffuse burning sensations, twitching, disorientation, visual impairment, nausea, temperature intolerance, rash, and palpitations; she remained disabled after  months.

Agitation, confusion, and toxic psychosis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Crystalluria has been reported in patients with alkaline urine and did not necessarily lead to nephrotoxicity.
At physiological urinary pH, the risk of crystalluria was considered minor.

Local IV site reactions occurred more often if the infusion time was  minutes or less.
These reactions have appeared as local skin reactions and resolved quickly when infusion was completed.
Injection site irritation and induration have been reported with IV infusion time  minutes or less (instead of the recommended  hour) or when a small vein in the back of the hand was used.
Common ( to ): Local IV site reactions, injection and infusion site reactions (, phlebitis, thrombophlebitis)Frequency not reported: Injection site irritation and induration with IV infusion
Uncommon ( to ): Musculoskeletal pain (, extremity pain, back pain, chest pain), arthralgiaRare ( to ): Myalgia, arthritis, increased muscle tone and cramping, tendon rupture (mainly Achilles tendon)Very rare (less than ): Tendinitis, muscular weaknessFrequency not reported: Arthropathy (including suspected reversible cases), joint stiffness, elevated serum creatine phosphokinase, abnormal joint exam, joint sprains, arthrosis, bone pain, decreased range of motion in a joint (knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, shoulder), jaw pain, neck pain, gout flare-up, joint swelling, muscle spasms, night cramps, knee inflammationPostmarketing reports: Myoclonus, myasthenia, twitching
Arthropathy has primarily been a concern in pediatric patients; however, at least  case was described in an adult cystic fibrosis patient receiving this drug.
Although cystic fibrosis arthropathy and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy typically occur in  to  of cystic fibrosis adults and adolescents, the arthropathy exhibited in this patient did not resemble either.
Several elements in its presentation strongly supported the diagnosis of ciprofloxacin-induced arthropathy, such as: a consistent time of onset with other reported cases of suspected quinolone-induced arthropathy (usually  weeks after starting therapy); a lack of history of arthralgia in the patient; reoccurrence upon rechallenge; and resolution of symptoms upon discontinuation of therapy (usually  weeks after therapy stopped).
Tendinitis with subsequent tendon rupture has been documented in numerous case reports.
One patient with chronic renal failure developed bilateral Achilles tendon rupture after  days of ciprofloxacin therapy.
Although renal transplant patients and those with end-stage renal disease tend to have an increased risk of Achilles tendinitis and rupture over the general population, quinolone use has been shown to further increase that risk ( in quinolone-treated patients versus  in nonquinolone-treated patients).
As of October ,  cases of Achilles tendon rupture had been reported to the US FDA.
Some ruptures have also occurred in the hand or shoulder.
Other risk factors identified included age and corticosteroid use.
There had been  reports of tendinitis submitted to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Committee (ADRAC) between  and , including reports of Achilles tendinitis, tendon rupture, and tendon pain and swelling.
The reports were primarily in male patients ( cases) older than  years who used this drug for  to  days.
In  of the reported cases, a fluoroquinolone (generally ciprofloxacin) was the primary suspect; however, details of concomitant serious medical conditions were not documented in most of the reports.
Musculoskeletal side effects reported in pediatric patients included arthralgia, abnormal gait, abnormal joint exam, joint sprains, leg pain, back pain, arthrosis, bone pain, pain, myalgia, arm pain, and decreased range of motion in a joint (knee, elbow, ankle, hip, wrist, shoulder).
Myalgia, tendinitis, and tendon rupture have also been reported during postmarketing experience.

Cases of allergic interstitial nephritis often responded to short courses of corticosteroid therapy.
Uncommon ( to ): Visual disturbances (, chromatopsia, diplopia, photopsia)Very rare (less than ): Visual color distortionsFrequency not reported: Decreased visual acuity, blurred vision, cataracts, multiple punctate lenticular opacities, eye pain

Allergic reactions ranged from urticaria to anaphylactic reactions, including life-threatening anaphylactic shock.
At least  cases have been reported of patients developing a cutaneous vasculitis related to use of this drug.
The vasculitis resolved without medical intervention after the drug was discontinued.
Serum sickness-like reaction and anaphylactic shock (life-threatening) have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
