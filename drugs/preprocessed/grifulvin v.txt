Fixed-drug eruptions, photosensitivity, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and SLE-like syndromes have been reported.
A patient with Hailey-Hailey disease (chronic benign familial pemphigus) experienced a widespread bullous eruption due to griseofulvin (the active ingredient contained in Grifulvin V) therapy.
Lesions have commonly begun on sun-exposed areas.
