As well as its needed effects, pyridoxine may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.

If any of the following side effects occur while taking pyridoxine, check with your doctor or nurse as soon as possible:
The profound sensory loss following treatment with high doses of parenteral pyridoxine may not be reversible.
Nervous system side effects have included sensory neuropathy with axonal degeneration.
The adverse neurologic side effects have been reported following a single large dose (10 g) administered intravenously.
It may rarely occur following chronic administration of lower doses.
Peripheral sensory neuropathy has also been reported.
Hypersensitivity side effects have been reported rarely.
Dermatologic side effects have included allergic contact dermatitis.
Photosensitivity has been confirmed in a female patient taking pyridoxine 100 mg orally daily.
It is possible that some side effects of pyridoxine may not have been reported.
