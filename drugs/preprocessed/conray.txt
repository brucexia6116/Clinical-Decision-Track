Common ( to ): Anaphylactoid reactionsFrequency not reported: Dermal manifestations (urticaria with or without pruritus, erythema, maculopapular rash); dry mouth, sweating, conjunctival symptoms; facial, peripheral, and angioneurotic edema; symptoms related to the respiratory system include sneezing, nasal stuffiness, coughing, choking, dyspnea, chest tightness and wheezing, which may be initial manifestations of more severe and infrequent reactions including asthmatic attack, laryngospasm and bronchospasm with or without edema, pulmonary edema, apnea and cyanosis
