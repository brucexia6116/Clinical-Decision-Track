As well as its needed effects, smallpox vaccine may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking smallpox vaccine, check with your doctor immediately:
Some smallpox vaccine side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
Regional lymphadenopathy, myalgia, fever, nausea, and malaise occur at the height of the major reaction after vaccination, indicating the vaccination was successful.
Fever commonly occurs in children after vaccination but is less common in adults.
From  to  days after primary vaccination at least  of children have had  or more days of temperature greater than  degrees F.
Fifteen to twenty percent have had temperatures greater than  degrees F.
The most frequent complication is inadvertent inoculation of other sites, usually due of autoinoculation of the virus transferred from the vaccination site to other parts of the body.
The face, eyelids, nose, mouth, genitalia, and rectum are most commonly involved.
Autoinoculation of the eyes may cause blindness.
Postvaccinial encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, encephalopathy, progressive vaccinia (vaccinia necrosum) and eczema vaccinatum are more severe complications that may occur following primary vaccination or revaccination.
Severe disability, permanent neurological sequelae, and/or death may occur.
Approximately  death per million primary vaccinations and  death per  million revaccinations have been reported, most often due to encephalitis or progressive vaccinia.
Death has also occurred in unvaccinated contacts of vaccinated persons.
Vaccinia viremia has been rarely reported after vaccination.
Vaccinia Immune Globulin may be indicated for certain vaccine complications such as eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, severe generalized vaccinia, or severe ocular vaccinia and may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
Physicians may contact the CDC for assistance with diagnosis and treatment of smallpox vaccine complications.
Telephone:  - (Monday-Friday,  AM-: PM EST) or  - (at other times).
Healthy persons may develop generalized vaccinia with a generally self-limited vesicular or maculopapular rash within  to  days after vaccination.
This condition is more serious in immunocompromised individuals.
Eczema vaccinatum appears shortly after the vaccinial lesion appears and is characterized by a high fever, malaise, generalized lymphadenopathy, and extensive vesicular and pustular eruptions.
Patients with a history of atopic dermatitis have the highest risk of developing EV.
The prognosis is poor and the mortality rate is high.
Progressive vaccinia (i.
e.
, vaccinia necrosum, vaccinia gangrenosa, prolonged vaccinia, disseminated vaccinia), is characterized by a nonhealing vaccination site, painless progressive necrosis at the vaccination site, and occasionally metastasis to other parts of the skin, bones, and viscera.
The distant lesions contain live vaccinia virus.
Immunocompromised patients are at a greater risk.
The prognosis is poor.
Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG) may be indicated for eczema vaccinatum or progressive vaccinia and may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
Physicians may contact the CDC for assistance with diagnosis and treatment of smallpox vaccine complications.
Telephone:  - (Monday-Friday,  AM-: PM EST) or  - (at other times).
Hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme have rarely been reported.
The onset of symptoms (bulls-eye lesions and pruritus) is generally  days after vaccination.
Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and benign dermatofibroma have been reported in smallpox vaccination scars.
Contact spread of vaccinia from recently vaccinated military personnel has been reported.
Dermatologic side effects have included pruritus, rash, generalized vaccinia (GV), eczema vaccinatum (EV), progressive vaccinia (PV), erythema multiforme, folliculitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, bacterial infections, and contact spread.
In addition, precipitation of erythema nodosum in patients with leprosy, malignant tumors at the vaccination scar, discoid lupus, and localized myxedema have been reported; however, causality has not been established.
Local side effects have included secondary pyogenic infections at the site of vaccine application.
occurring approximately  days after vaccination.
Swelling, warmth, and pain at the injection site, with peak symptoms occurring  to  days after vaccination and resolving within  to  hours, are indicative of a normal vaccination reaction.
Hypersensitivity reactions may include persistent allergic sensitization to viral proteins even after immunity has waned.
The allergy is manifested by the appearance of a papule and a small area of redness appearing within the first  hours after revaccination.
Vesicles may appear in  to  hours, followed by scabbing.
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and erythema multiforme have also been reported.
Ocular side effects have included mild to severe ocular vaccinia resulting from inadvertent autoinoculation and manifested by keratitis (epithelial and stromal), iritis, conjunctivitis (hyperemia, edema, membranes, focal lesions), and/or blepharitis (lid pustules, edema, hyperemia, cellulitis).
Corneal scarring, disciform edema, and loss of vision have occurred in patients with vaccinial keratitis.
Lymphadenopathy and fever have also been associated with ocular vaccinia.
Ocular vaccinia has been reported in contacts of vaccinees.
Trifluridine or vidarabine ophthalmic ointment have been recommended for conjunctival or corneal vaccinia infections.
In addition, vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) may be considered for severe blepharitis, blepharoconjunctivitis, or keratitis (if there is a risk of vision loss).
When using of VIG for keratitis, the possibility of an increased risk of corneal scar formation (associated with large doses over multiple days in animal models) should be taken into consideration.
VIG is not recommended for isolated keratitis.
VIG may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
Physicians may contact the CDC for assistance with diagnosis and treatment of smallpox vaccine complications.
Telephone:  - (Monday-Friday,  AM-: PM EST) or  - (at other times).
Nervous system side effects have rarely included headache, dizziness, paresthesia, vertigo, transient global amnesia, anoxic encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, cerebrovascular accident, CNS tumor, precipitation of neuritis in leprosy patients, transverse myelitis, seizures, paralysis, polyneuritis, brachial neuritis, and one case of ptosis, diplopia, slurred speech, and paresis, although causality has not been clearly established in all cases.
The vaccine has also been associated with encephalitis (PVE) and encephalomyelitis (PVEM).
PVE is has a sudden onset ( to  days after vaccination) and is characterized by seizures, hemiplegia, aphasia, transient amnesia, generalized cerebral edema, mild lymphocytic meningeal infiltration, ganglion degenerative changes, and perivascular hemorrhages.
Cerebrospinal fluid examination may demonstrate increased opening CSF pressure, monocytosis, lymphocytosis, or elevated CSF protein.
PVEM is characterized by sudden onset ( to  days after vaccination) of fever, headache, malaise, lethargy, vomiting, and anorexia.
Symptoms may progress to unconsciousness, amnesia, confusion, disorientation, restlessness, delirium, drowsiness, seizures, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, constipation, meningismus and/or coma.
Increased CSF pressure is present, but chemistry and cell count may be normal.
Histopathological changes include perivenous demyelination, microglial proliferation in demyelinated areas with lymphocytic infiltration.
PVE occurs more commonly in children less than  years old.
The incidence in  was reported as  cases per million vaccinees.
The mortality rate is ,  complete recovery occurs in , and neurologic sequelae remain in .
Cardiovascular side effects have rarely included myocarditis, pericarditis, myocardial infarction, hypertension, atypical chest pain, angina, palpitations, supraventricular tachycardia, atrial dysrhythmias, symptomatic trigeminy, premature ventricular contractions, coronary artery disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, sudden death due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease  days after vaccination, and chest tightness with ECG changes, although causality has not been clearly established in all cases.
Symptoms of myopericarditis include chest pain, ECG changes, increased cardiac enzymes, and sometimes abnormal echocardiograms, and usually occur  to  days after vaccination.
Pulmonary edema and eosinophilic myopericarditis developed in a -year-old male  weeks after multiple vaccinations including smallpox vaccine.
Musculoskeletal side effects have included osteomyelitis, arthritis, shoulder pain, and noncardiac chest pain; however, causality has not been established in all cases.
Respiratory side effects have rarely included asthma, pneumonia, respiratory distress, and pseudomediastinum associated with scuba diving, although causality has not been clearly established.
Genitourinary side effects have rarely included prostatitis, although causality has not been clearly established.
Gastrointestinal side effects have rarely included cholecystitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease, although causality has not been clearly established in all cases.
It is possible that some side effects of smallpox vaccine may not have been reported.
These can be reported to the FDA here.
