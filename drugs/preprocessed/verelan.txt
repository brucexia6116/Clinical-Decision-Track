Common side effects of Verelan include: sinus bradycardia.
Other side effects include: pulmonary edema, severe hypotension, and second degree atrioventricular block.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, verapamil (the active ingredient contained in Verelan) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
Some verapamil side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
