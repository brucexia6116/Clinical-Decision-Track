Side effects differed between hydatid disease and neurocysticercosis.
Symptoms were generally mild and resolved without treatment.
Therapy was discontinued primarily due to leukopenia (0.
7%) or hepatic abnormalities (3.
8% in hydatid disease).
Very common (10% or more): Elevated liver enzymes (up to 16%)Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): HepatitisFrequency not reported: Hepatotoxicity, hepatic abnormalities, jaundice, hepatocellular damagePostmarketing reports: Acute liver failure
Mild to moderate elevated liver enzymes were very common.
Severe hepatic abnormalities, including jaundice and hepatocellular damage (possibly irreversible), have been reported during prolonged higher dose treatment of hydatid disease.
Elevated liver enzymes and hepatitis have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Very common (10% or more): Headache (up to 11%)Common (1% to 10%): Raised intracranial pressure, dizziness, neurological eventsUncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Vertigo, meningeal signsPostmarketing reports: Somnolence, convulsion

Reversible alopecia (thinning of hair and moderate hair loss) has also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Fever has also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Common (1% to 10%): Fever, hyperpyrexiaPostmarketing reports: Asthenia
Agranulocytosis and pancytopenia have also been reported during postmarketing experience.
Patients with liver disease (including hepatic echinococcosis) appeared more susceptible to bone marrow suppression.
Common (1% to 10%): LeukopeniaRare (less than 0.
1%): Low red cell count, pancytopenia, thrombocytopeniaFrequency not reported: Granulocytopenia, agranulocytosisPostmarketing reports: Aplastic anemia, bone marrow suppression, neutropenia
Uncommon (0.
1% to 1%): Hypersensitivity reactions (including rash, pruritus, urticaria)
