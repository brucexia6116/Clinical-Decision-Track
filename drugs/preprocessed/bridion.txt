The most commonly reported adverse reactions have included vomiting, pain, nausea, hypotension and headache.
Common ( to ): Abnormal ECG, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, abnormal or prolonged QT intervalPostmarketing reports: Bradycardia with cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular block, cardiac/cardiorespiratory arrest, ST segment changes, supraventricular tachycardia/extrasystoles, tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia
Cases of marked bradycardia, some resulting in cardiac arrest, have occurred within minutes of administering this drug.
Cardiac electrophysiology studies have shown that at  times the maximum recommended dose, the QT interval was not prolonged to any clinically relevant extent.
In a dedicated hypersensitivity study in healthy volunteers, anaphylaxis occurred in  of  patients .
This patient experienced anaphylaxis with the first dose ( mg/kg) and symptoms included conjunctival edema, urticaria, erythema, swelling of the uvula, and reduction in peak expiratory flow.
Hypersensitivity reactions including nausea, pruritus, and urticaria occurred in a dose-related manner with more reactions occurring in the  mg/kg dose group compared to the  mg/kg group.
Anaphylaxis has been reported at all doses.
The most commonly described reactions included in reports of anaphylaxis have included dermatologic reactions (, urticaria, rash, erythema, flushing, and skin eruption), and clinically important hypotension often requiring vasopressors for circulatory support.
There have also been reports of prolonged hospitalization with the use of additional respiratory support in some patients.
Uncommon ( to ): Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reactionsPostmarketing reports: Anaphylactic shock, anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, Type I hypersensitivity
Common ( to ): Nausea (up to ), vomiting (up to )Uncommon ( to ): Abdominal pain, flatulence, dry mouth
Bronchospasm was observed in patients with a history of pulmonary complications.
Common ( to ): Airway complication of anesthesia, oropharyngeal pain, coughFrequency not reported: BronchospasmPostmarketing reports: Laryngospasm, dyspnea, wheezing, pulmonary edema, respiratory arrest
Common ( to ): Pruritus, erythema
Common ( to ): Decreased red blood cell count, hematoma, anemia
Common ( to ): Injection site pain
Common ( to ): Hypocalcemia
Common ( to ): Extremity pain, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, creatine phosphokinase increased
Common ( to ): Headache, dizziness, hypoesthesia, dysgeusia
In clinical studies using this drug at doses labeled for the depth of neuromuscular blockade (n=), less than  of patients were observed to have recurrence of neuromuscular blockade as based on neuromuscular monitoring or clinical evidence.
Airway complications of anesthesia have included bucking against the endotracheal tube, coughing, mild bucking, arousal reaction during surgery, coughing during the anesthetic procedure or during surgery, or anesthetic procedure related spontaneous breath of patient.
Anesthetic complications include reports of the restoration of neuromuscular function (, movement of limb or body, grimacing, or suckling on the endotracheal tube).
Procedural complications include coughing, tachycardia, bradycardia, movement, and increased heart rate.

Common ( to ): Insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, depression, sleep disorder
