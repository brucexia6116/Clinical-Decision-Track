Very common ( or more): Peripheral edemaCommon ( to ): Angina (with concomitant levodopa use), postural hypotension, hot flashes, cardiac valvulopathy, hypotension, dependent edema, palpitationUncommon ( to ): ErythromelalgiaRare (less than ): Syncope, heart failure Frequency not reported: Constrictive pericarditis, digital vasospasmPostmarketing reports: Cardiac valvulopathy, pericarditis, pericardial effusion
Reports of cardiac valvulopathy have generally been received in patients on higher doses (greater than  mg/day); however, there have been cases in patients receiving lower doses for the treatment of hyperprolactinemic disorders.
In a multi-country, retrospective cohort study, record review looking for an association between the new use of dopamine agonists (including this drug; n=,) and cardiac valvular regurgitation (CVR), other fibrosis, and other cardiopulmonary events found an increased risk of CVR among patients with Parkinson's disease when compared to non-ergot derived dopamine agonists and levodopa.
Analysis in patients with hyperprolactinemia treated with this drug (n=) found that compared to non-users, exposed persons did not have an elevated risk of CVR.
These findings are consistent with other published studies.
Frequency not reported: Leg cramps
Uncommon ( to ): Rash, acne, pruritus Frequency not reported: Alopecia

Adverse effects are generally dose related.
At lower doses, the more commonly reported adverse reactions included nausea, headache, dizziness/vertigo, abdominal pain/dyspepsia/gastritis, asthenia/fatigue; at higher doses, additional events of valvulopathy, dyspnea, dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, hallucination, and constipation have been commonly reported.
