Elderly patients (mean =  years old) enrolled in placebo-controlled studies examining the use of aripiprazole (the active ingredient contained in Aristada) for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis showed an increased incidence of cerebrovascular side effects,   stroke and transient ischemia attacks, including fatalities.
The incidence of these effects may be dose related.
In a dose response analysis, somnolence including sedation was the only adverse reaction determined to have a dose response relationship in adult patients.
Somnolence was reported in  of adult patients with schizophrenia receiving the  mg dose.
In pediatric patients  to  years of age, extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and tremor displayed possible dose response relationship in patients with schizophrenia, while extrapyramidal disorder, somnolence, and akathisia displayed possible dose response relationship in pediatric patients with bipolar mania.
Extrapyramidal symptoms were more prevalent with use of the extended-release IM injection compared with oral formulations ( versus ).
Akathisia was the most frequently observed adverse event with the extended-release IM injection; it typically starts around day  and lasts a median of  days.

Reports of diabetes mellitus included increases in blood insulin, decreases in carbohydrate tolerance, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, and glycosuria.
Analysis of  placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adult patients primarily with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder revealed a mean increase in fasting blood glucose of  mg/dL with a median exposure of  days.
This was not significantly different from placebo (+ mg/dL, median exposure  days).
A pooled analysis in pediatric patients revealed a mean change in fasting glucose of  mg/dL compared with  mg/dL in placebo treated patients following  weeks of therapy.
In long-term, open label schizophrenia studies with aripiprazole lauroxil,  of patients with HbAc less than  at baseline developed levels of  or higher post-baseline.
Undesirable alterations in lipids have been observed in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics.
Analyses of patients receiving this drug are limited due to the small number of patients who received this drug for extended periods in the clinical trials.
In long-term, open label schizophrenia studies with aripiprazole lauroxil, shifts in fasting total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides from normal to high were reported in , , and  of patients.
Weight gain has been observed in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics.
Analysis of  placebo-controlled monotherapy trials in adult patients primarily with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder revealed a mean change in weight of + kg (n=) with a median exposure of  to  days compared with a decrease of  kg in placebo treated patients (n=).
A pooled analysis in pediatric patients ( to  years) revealed a mean change in weight of + kg (n=) compared with + kg (n=) in placebo treated patients following  weeks of therapy.
In a -week, fixed dose schizophrenia study in patients receiving with aripiprazole lauroxil, IM weight gain of  or greater from baseline was observed in  (n=) and  (n=) of patients receiving  mg and  mg IM, respectively.
During clinical trials, the percentage of pediatric and adolescent patients by indication with weight gain of  or more of body weight compared to placebo was ( vs ), ( vs ), and ( vs ), respectively for schizophrenia/bipolar mania, irritability associated with autistic disorder, and Tourette's disorder, respectively.
Treatment durations were  to  weeks,  weeks, and  to  weeks, respectively.

Collective data from  placebo-controlled clinical studies involving the use of atypical antipsychotic agents in the elderly patient with dementia showed a risk of death  to  times greater in the drug-treated patient than in the placebo-treated patient.
The average length of duration for the trials was  weeks with the cause of death in the majority of cases, though not all, reported as either cardiovascular (, heart failure, sudden death) or infectious (, pneumonia) in nature.
Although aripiprazole (the active ingredient contained in Aristada) was not included in these studies, the consistent findings across all three relevant chemical classes support the opinion that these findings are likely to be applicable to all atypical antipsychotic agents.
Aripiprazole is not indicated for use in the treatment of behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia.
