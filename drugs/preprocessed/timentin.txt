The risk of significant bleeding may be increased in patients over the age of  years, patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, patients with preexisting thrombocytopenia, and azotemia, and patients undergoing surgical procedures.
Leukopenia has been reported in  of patients with liver disease receiving beta-lactam antibiotics.
Common ( to ): Elevated eosinophils, thrombocytosisVery rare (less than ): Hemolytic anemiaFrequency not reported: Bleeding manifestations, immune hemolytic anemia, positive Coombs testPostmarketing reports: Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, decreased hemoglobin or hematocrit, prolonged prothrombin time and bleeding time
Common ( to ): Elevated AST, elevated ALTPostmarketing reports: Elevated AST, elevated ALT, elevated serum bilirubin, transient hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice
Common ( to ): Nausea, diarrheaFrequency not reported: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrheaPostmarketing reports: Stomatitis, flatulence, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, epigastric pain, pseudomembranous colitis
Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms has been reported during or after antibacterial therapy.
Common ( to ): RashPostmarketing reports: Skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, bullous reactions (including erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
Common ( to ): Injection site phlebitisFrequency not reported: Injection site erythema, injection site infiltrationPostmarketing reports: Injection site pain, injection site burning, injection site swelling, injection site induration, thrombophlebitis with IV administration
Postmarketing reports: Headache, giddiness, neuromuscular hyperirritability, convulsive seizures, taste and smell disturbances

Postmarketing reports: Hypersensitivity reactions (including skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, arthralgia, myalgia, drug fever, chills, chest discomfort, bronchospasm, wheezing, anaphylactic reactions, bullous reactions [including erythema multiforme, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome])
Postmarketing reports: Elevated serum creatinine and/or BUN
Postmarketing reports: Arthralgia, myalgia
Postmarketing reports: Drug fever, chills, chest discomfort, decreased serum potassium
Postmarketing reports: Bronchospasm, wheezing
Frequency not reported: HypokalemiaPostmarketing reports: Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase, elevated serum LDH, hypernatremia, decreased uric acid
Some studies have shown a correlation between the degree of hypokalemia and the dose of ticarcillin in addition to the serum BUN/creatinine ratio.
These findings suggest that dehydration and high doses may be risk factors for hypokalemia.
Frequency not reported: Vaginal yeast infectionsPostmarketing reports: Hemorrhagic cystitis
An increased incidence of vaginal yeast infections has been associated with penicillins.
Frequency not reported: Hallucinations
