As well as its needed effects, methimazole (the active ingredient contained in Northyx) may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.

If any of the following side effects occur while taking methimazole, check with your doctor immediately:
Some methimazole side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The onset of aplastic anemia (pancytopenia) or agranulocytosis may occur in hours to days.
Most cases of agranulocytosis occur within the first 90 days of treatment, but this complication can occur even a year or more after starting therapy.
Studies have suggested that the risk of agranulocytosis is greater in older patients and that they have a higher rate of death.
Hematologic side effects have included inhibition of myelopoiesis (agranulocytosis (0.
35%), granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia), aplastic anemia, and hypoprothrombinemia.
Approximately 10% of patients with untreated hyperthyroidism have experienced leukopenia, often with relative granulopenia.
Immunologic side effects have included insulin autoimmune syndrome and lupus-like syndrome.
Hepatic side effects have included hepatitis and jaundice (which may persist for several weeks following discontinuation of the drug).
Renal side effects have rarely included nephritis.
A 5-year-old female experienced aplasia cutis congenita coincident with in utero exposure to methimazole (the active ingredient contained in Northyx)   She presented with hairless scars on her scalp.
At birth the lesions were friable and bled easily, however, over time they became scar-like and thicker.
At the time of conception, her mother was receiving therapy for Graves' disease with methimazole 20 mg daily.
Aplasia cutis congenita has been reported as a possible teratogenic effect of methimazole therapy in multiple case reports.
However, the causal relationship between the therapy and the skin defect is controversial, and anomalies related to methimazole have low birth prevalence.
Dermatologic side effects including urticaria (5%), macular rash (5%), rash, pruritus, abnormal loss of hair, and skin pigmentation have been reported.
Aplasia cutis congenita has also been reported.
Musculoskeletal side effects have included arthralgia (5%) and myalgia.
Nervous system side effects have included paresthesia, headache, drowsiness, neuritis, and vertigo.
Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects have included GI upset (5%), nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, and taste disturbances.
Pancreatitis has been reported very rarely.
A 67-year-old female with a history of Graves' disease and mild bilateral ophthalmopathy experienced carotid cavernous fistula coincident with methimazole (the active ingredient contained in Northyx) therapy.
She was treated with radioiodine following 10-years of therapy with methimazole.
Evaluation of the patient with sensitive techniques lead to the diagnosis of carotid cavernous fistula.
This is the first report of the simultaneous occurrence of Graves' ophthalmopathy and carotid cavernous fistula.
Ocular side effects including at least one case of carotid cavernous fistula have been reported.
Cardiovascular side effects including vasculitis have been reported.
Metabolic side effects including rare reports of hypoglycemia have been reported.
Other side effects have included edema, periarteritis, sialadenopathy, lymphadenopathy, and fever.
Abnormal sense of taste or smell has also been reported rarely.
It is possible that some side effects of Northyx may not have been reported.
These can be reported to the FDA here.
Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
