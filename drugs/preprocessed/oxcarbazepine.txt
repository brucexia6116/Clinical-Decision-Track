Commonly reported side effects of oxcarbazepine include: dizziness.
See below for a comprehensive list of adverse effects.
As well as its needed effects, oxcarbazepine may cause unwanted side effects that require medical attention.
If any of the following side effects occur while taking oxcarbazepine, check with your doctor immediately:
Some oxcarbazepine side effects may not need any medical attention.
As your body gets used to the medicine these side effects may disappear.
Your health care professional may be able to help you prevent or reduce these side effects, but do check with them if any of the following side effects continue, or if you are concerned about them:
The most commonly observed side effects were dizziness, somnolence, diplopia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, abnormal vision, abdominal pain, tremor, dyspepsia, abnormal gait, headache, balance disorder, and asthenia.
In clinical trials in children aged  month to  years, the most commonly reported side effect was somnolence.
The side effects most commonly associated with discontinuation of oxcarbazepine included dizziness, vomiting, nausea, diplopia, and somnolence.
The pattern of seizures following oxcarbazepine discontinuation suggests a rebound phenomenon rather than a loss of therapeutic efficacy.
Very common ( or more): Abnormal gait, ataxia, dizziness, headache, nystagmus, somnolence, tremorCommon ( to ): Abnormal coordination, abnormal EEG, amnesia, ataxia, balance disorder, convulsions aggravated, cranial injury not otherwise specified, dysmetria, gait disturbance, hypoesthesia, impaired concentration, involuntary muscle contractions, speech disorder, taste perversionFrequency not reported: Aura, depressed level of consciousness, dystonia, extrapyramidal disorder, hemiplegia, hyperreflexia, hyperkinesia, hyporeflexia, hypokinesia, hypotonia, migraine, muscle hypertonia, neuralgia, oculogyric crisis, paralysis, syncope, tinnitus
Common ( to ): Abnormal thinking, agitation, anxiety, apathy, confusion, depression, insomnia, emotional lability, nervousnessFrequency not reported: Aggressive reaction, anguish, anxiety, aphasia, delirium, delusion, dysphonia, euphoria, hysteria, manic reaction, panic disorder, paroniria, personality disorder, psychosis, stupor, suicidal behavior and ideation
Pooled analyses of  placebo-controlled clinical trials of  different antiepileptic drugs lasting a median of  weeks showed that patients receiving antiepileptic drugs had approximately twice the risk of suicidal behavior or ideation  compared to patients receiving placebo .
The increased risk of suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation was observed as early as one week after starting the antiepileptic drug and continued through  weeks.
Patients with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele B* or HLA-A* may be at an increased risk for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).
The presence of the HLA-A* allele may also increase the risk for drug rash with eosinophilia (DRESS), or less severe acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) and maculopapular rash.
Rare cases of angioedema have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of oxcarbazepine.

Common ( to ): AllergyVery rare (less than ): Hypersensitivity (including multi-organ hypersensitivity), anaphylactic reactionsFrequency not reported: Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
Rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of oxcarbazepine.
Multi-organ hypersensitivity is generally characterized by signs and symptoms such as abnormal liver function tests, rash, and fever.
Other organs or symptoms that may be affected include the blood and lymphatic system (, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, leucopenia, splenomegaly), liver (, abnormal liver function tests, hepatitis), muscles and joints (, joint swelling, myalgia, arthralgia), nervous system (, hepatic encephalopathy), kidney (, proteinuria, interstitial nephritis, renal failure), and lungs (, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, asthma, bronchospasms, interstitial lung disease).

Hyponatremia associated with signs and symptoms such as seizures, confusion, depressed level of consciousness, encephalopathy, vision disorders, vomiting, nausea, and folic acid deficiency have been reported very rarely.
Common ( to ): Back pain, muscle weakness, sprains and strainsFrequency not reported: Musculoskeletal procedurePostmarketing reports: Decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures (long-term therapy)
Very common ( or more): Abnormal accommodation, abnormal vision, diplopiaCommon ( to ): Blurred vision, visual impairment/disturbanceFrequency not reported: Cataract, conjunctival hemorrhage, eye edema, hemianopia, mydriasis, photophobia, scotoma, xerophthalmia
